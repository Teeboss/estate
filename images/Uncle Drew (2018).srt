1
00:00:31,466 --> 00:00:33,816
Deep in the concrete canyons
of Harlem, New York

2
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:35,774
stands a basketball court

3
00:00:35,948 --> 00:00:38,734
where the legends of
the game are born.

4
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:40,475
Rucker Park.

5
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:42,955
Between the lines of
this battleground,

6
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:46,046
a great many tales of
warriors have come and gone.

7
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,960
But there was one player

8
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:50,833
whose talent soared
far above the rest.

9
00:00:51,007 --> 00:00:53,575
His name, Uncle Drew.

10
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,186
- So good.
- Incredible.

11
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,405
Like, scary good.

12
00:00:57,579 --> 00:00:59,189
- Dominating.
- Dangerous.

13
00:00:59,363 --> 00:01:01,104
- Best of the best.
- Bananas.

14
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:03,039
I mean, you knew he just
brought things to the game

15
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,499
that the game had
never seen before.

16
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:05,913
Changed the face of basketball.

17
00:01:06,022 --> 00:01:07,632
Drew been dangerous since birth.

18
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:10,418
My pops played him one-on-one
in the seventh grade.

19
00:01:10,592 --> 00:01:12,550
He broke my pop's ankle.

20
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:15,814
True story. Gym teacher
gave him a "D."

21
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:17,348
You know, he'll
show you one trick,

22
00:01:17,468 --> 00:01:19,209
then beat you with
another trick.

23
00:01:19,383 --> 00:01:21,664
Shakin' people's sneakers off.
They fallin' out the trees.

24
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:25,868
He was a bad man.

25
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:26,869
He went to one end of the court,

26
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:28,305
shot the lights out,

27
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,674
went to the other
end of the court,

28
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:31,047
shot it back on again.

29
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:32,744
Man, he was good
enough to be the logo.

30
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:34,616
Wait, I thought you
were the NBA logo.

31
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:37,271
It's actually Uncle Drew. They
just shaved his afro off.

32
00:01:38,881 --> 00:01:40,491
One time, he took
on "The Destroyer"

33
00:01:40,665 --> 00:01:42,493
and beat him only
with his left hand.

34
00:01:42,667 --> 00:01:44,408
And then, hold on. Wait for it.

35
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:47,411
With his right hand, he was
eating a ham sandwich.

36
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:51,894
Was there anyone out there
better than Uncle Drew?

37
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:53,852
With word of Sandwichgate

38
00:01:54,026 --> 00:01:56,464
and Black Ankle Sunday both
spreading like wildfire,

39
00:01:56,638 --> 00:01:58,944
Uncle Drew and his
childhood friends

40
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,644
shot to the top of the first
Rucker Classic in '68.

41
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:06,561
But it was not long before
it all came crashing down.

42
00:02:06,735 --> 00:02:08,128
It had to be something

43
00:02:08,302 --> 00:02:09,801
concerning him and a female.
We knew that.

44
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:12,654
Uncle Drew and the ladies? Yeah.

45
00:02:12,828 --> 00:02:15,135
Man, the rumor was
Drew slept with

46
00:02:15,309 --> 00:02:18,616
one of his teammate's girl
the night before the finals.

47
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,316
And when it came time
to play in the finals,

48
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,058
they were all a complete
and total no-show.

49
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,322
And after that he
just disappeared.

50
00:02:28,496 --> 00:02:30,498
Despite the mysterious
disappearance

51
00:02:30,672 --> 00:02:32,195
of its greatest player,

52
00:02:32,369 --> 00:02:34,632
the fabled park is
still the epicenter

53
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:36,634
of the streetball universe.

54
00:02:36,808 --> 00:02:39,985
The question is, will this
year's Rucker Classic

55
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,032
see the birth of a new
playground legend?

56
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:07,012
Give me that.

57
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,623
- Yo, what's up?
- What was that?

58
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:09,624
Hey, what's the problem, man?
Mario was open.

59
00:03:09,798 --> 00:03:11,016
Maybe Mario was open,

60
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,844
maybe he wasn't.
But you know what

61
00:03:13,018 --> 00:03:14,411
- the problem with that is?
- Huh?

62
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:15,954
Mario. Hey, I don't
know what you doin'...

63
00:03:15,978 --> 00:03:17,414
- Close your ears!
- Mmm-hmm.

64
00:03:17,588 --> 00:03:19,851
Mario is terrible. Okay?
Look at him.

65
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:21,766
I just told a grown man
to cover his ears,

66
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,570
- and that's what he just did.
- Coach, what are you saying?

67
00:03:23,594 --> 00:03:24,943
Grab the ball, Casper.

68
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:29,339
- You are my Beyonce. Okay?
- Beyonce?

69
00:03:29,513 --> 00:03:33,213
Not Dantay, not White
Dantay, not Regular Jeff,

70
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:35,476
not Little Melvin, not Little
Melvin's stunt double.

71
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:37,105
Okay, they're just
Destiny's Children.

72
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:39,480
You are the star.
You are my Queen B.

73
00:03:39,654 --> 00:03:41,395
- All right.
- Let's make Lemonade, man.

74
00:03:41,569 --> 00:03:42,831
Score the rock.

75
00:03:43,005 --> 00:03:44,528
All right, now look
here, everybody.

76
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:46,550
I'mma say this once. Nobody
else shoot the ball.

77
00:03:46,574 --> 00:03:49,011
Just Casper. Let's go.

78
00:03:50,882 --> 00:03:53,929
Dax Winslow. Sal
Masekela, SlamMagazine.

79
00:03:54,103 --> 00:03:55,887
- SlamMagazine, huh?
- Yes, sir.

80
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:57,701
You mind if I get a
couple of sound bites?

81
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,935
Do I mind? No, you shoulda
been talking to me.

82
00:04:00,109 --> 00:04:02,720
Um...

83
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:06,071
How does a guy who
works at Foot Locker

84
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,073
get a beast like Casper Jones

85
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:09,814
to play for him in Rucker Park?

86
00:04:09,988 --> 00:04:13,905
Game recognize game.
He's the best player.

87
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:15,079
I'm the best coach.

88
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:16,604
We gonna take it all.

89
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:18,146
I'm telling you, this
dude is amazing, man.

90
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,520
Put me and Casper on the cover.

91
00:04:21,478 --> 00:04:22,934
- You know who that is, right?
- Know who who is?

92
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,177
Who Mookie Bass is.

93
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,397
A.k.a. that
Macklemore-lookin' dude

94
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:29,834
that's makin' eyes at
your meal ticket, man.

95
00:04:32,315 --> 00:04:33,969
The hell is he doing here?

96
00:04:34,143 --> 00:04:36,145
Hey, what's up, Dix?

97
00:04:36,319 --> 00:04:38,103
First of all, you
know my name is Dax.

98
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,888
A "bag of Dax" don't
make no sense.

99
00:04:40,062 --> 00:04:43,239
What is that? What's that smell?

100
00:04:43,413 --> 00:04:45,154
Is that a grudge?

101
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:47,567
Are you still holdin' a grudge
'cause I blocked your shot?

102
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:48,940
I have no recollection

103
00:04:49,114 --> 00:04:50,570
or even know what you
even talkin' about.

104
00:04:50,594 --> 00:04:52,117
Okay, let me refresh
your memory, then.

105
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,692
You're about to hit
a three-pointer.

106
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:55,618
Outta nowhere, a little
white boy comes up...

107
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:58,254
Bam! Blocked that shot, I
think, with my armpit.

108
00:04:58,428 --> 00:05:00,909
Well, but I do remember,
there was that Spalding...

109
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,626
You didn't even jump that high.
So like nipple...

110
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,010
It was high enough
that I could see

111
00:05:04,042 --> 00:05:05,482
your face like this.
You were like...

112
00:05:05,653 --> 00:05:07,655
Okay, stop! That's not...
I didn't do that.

113
00:05:07,829 --> 00:05:09,221
What are you doin'? Stop.

114
00:05:11,963 --> 00:05:14,139
Casper, take it from the top.
Do something, y'all.

115
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,316
Defense, Dantays, figure it out.

116
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,839
Casper Jones, huh?

117
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:20,015
Could you just literally
give me some space, man?

118
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:21,930
Yo, you seen this tat
though, right here?

119
00:05:22,104 --> 00:05:23,821
That's the one where I blocked
your shot and won the game.

120
00:05:23,845 --> 00:05:25,518
And then these are the only
ones that really matter.

121
00:05:25,542 --> 00:05:29,285
Bam! Seven of nine
Rucker Championships.

122
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:31,026
But don't you worry, Dix.

123
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,134
I got plenty of length on
my Dax for the next one.

124
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:35,378
I don't care. I don't wanna
hear about your man junk.

125
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:36,901
Is there a point to all this?

126
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:38,425
Yeah, I guess my point is,

127
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:39,619
when you have a
history of winning

128
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:40,949
as many titles as I do,

129
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:42,559
cats like Casper Jones,

130
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:44,779
they have a way of
gravitating towards you.

131
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:49,349
So I'll see you when
I see you, Dix.

132
00:05:55,485 --> 00:05:57,202
Hey, Casper. Hey, man, let
me talk to you real quick.

133
00:05:57,226 --> 00:05:58,666
- What's up, coach?
- We good, right?

134
00:05:58,836 --> 00:06:00,229
You know what I mean?
Me and you.

135
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:02,076
- Yeah, we all right.
- Do you need anything?

136
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,928
You know what'd be dope?
The new Space Jams.

137
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:06,583
They are amazing. They
pretty expensive, like $225.

138
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:08,629
- Straight fire, though.
- They fire.

139
00:06:08,803 --> 00:06:10,239
But you know what?

140
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:11,632
I just thought about it.

141
00:06:11,806 --> 00:06:13,126
I sold the last
pair this morning.

142
00:06:14,591 --> 00:06:16,351
The good news is, in
another week and a half,

143
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:18,421
we get new stock, and I
got a pair just for you.

144
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:20,275
- Okay. I like that.
- Yeah. You like that?

145
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:21,946
Yeah, yeah, we all right.

146
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,446
I got you, brother. So
it's me and you, we good?

147
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,790
- Yeah, we rollin'.
- You with me.

148
00:06:24,819 --> 00:06:26,019
- I'm with you, dog.
- Forever.

149
00:06:26,168 --> 00:06:27,648
- Forever.
- Dax and Casper.

150
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:29,190
- Yeah, you my bro.
- All right, man. I love you.

151
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:30,738
- Love you, too, man.
- We good, right?

152
00:06:30,912 --> 00:06:32,130
Yeah, no doubt. All right.

153
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:33,304
Cool.

154
00:06:40,356 --> 00:06:41,357
Don't worry, Dax.

155
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:46,667
Don't worry, Dax. We'll
find you a family.

156
00:06:47,755 --> 00:06:50,497
- Yes.
- All right!

157
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:52,281
We'll find you a family.

158
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:55,153
Yes!

159
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:57,068
Yes! Yes!

160
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,421
Oh! What a move by Jordan!

161
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:07,862
Jordan with the moves!

162
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:11,039
Man, what an inspiration!

163
00:07:11,213 --> 00:07:14,042
Just listen to the crowd!
They love him!

164
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:15,304
They love him!

165
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:20,483
They love him! They love him!

166
00:07:26,881 --> 00:07:27,969
Yes!

167
00:07:33,322 --> 00:07:34,454
Yo, can we run with you?

168
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:35,628
Yes, yes.

169
00:07:48,946 --> 00:07:51,035
No!

170
00:07:51,209 --> 00:07:52,646
You need to be on the bench!

171
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,343
- He's worthless!
- You suck, Dax!

172
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:55,755
- You need new glasses!
- He's the worst!

173
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:57,477
You suck!

174
00:07:57,651 --> 00:08:01,437
Dax, that was unbearable!

175
00:08:01,611 --> 00:08:02,656
Dream sequence...

176
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,225
Boy, you better than cable.

177
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:08,899
Look, you wouldn't
even understand, okay?

178
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:10,185
It's terrible.

179
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:11,684
Dreamin' about that
little white boy

180
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,014
slappin' that ball
out your hand?

181
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:14,861
- Now, how do I look?
- You look expensive.

182
00:08:14,885 --> 00:08:16,765
Man, you know I can't
afford Gucci on my salary.

183
00:08:16,844 --> 00:08:19,934
Which is why when you and
Casper win the Rucker

184
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:22,197
and the $100,000 check
that come with it,

185
00:08:22,371 --> 00:08:24,199
we'll be just fine.

186
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:25,592
Baby, I thought that 100K,

187
00:08:25,766 --> 00:08:26,960
we was gonna use
to start a family.

188
00:08:26,984 --> 00:08:29,726
I want a Tesla.

189
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,294
I would look so cute in a Tesla.

190
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:34,514
And I'd have the little
screen on the side

191
00:08:34,688 --> 00:08:36,143
and then I could be like,
"Boop, boop, boop, boop!"

192
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:38,039
And all my homegirls
gonna be like,

193
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:41,259
"Look at Jess killin'
'em in a Tesla."

194
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,479
Well, I mean, this sounds like

195
00:08:43,653 --> 00:08:46,177
a beautiful, beautiful
dream and everything,

196
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:47,918
but I didn't hear
my name one time.

197
00:08:48,092 --> 00:08:49,548
You didn't say, "Oh, Dax
was in the Tesla with me."

198
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:50,723
Baby, you gonna be there, too.

199
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:52,749
It's gonna be me and you,

200
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:54,664
and we just gonna be
one big happy family.

201
00:08:54,838 --> 00:08:56,274
I love that.

202
00:08:56,448 --> 00:08:58,233
Well, don't let the
ghost of white boy past

203
00:08:58,407 --> 00:08:59,843
scare you out of
gettin' this money.

204
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:02,106
You win this game, and
you win this money,

205
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,804
and bring it back home.

206
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:05,588
- I'm motivated, baby!
- Whoo!

207
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:10,724
Bam! That's right. These shoes
right here are classic.

208
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:12,179
I wore these shoes last
night, little man,

209
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:13,422
and I had a quadruple-double.

210
00:09:13,596 --> 00:09:15,250
- Look.
- That's right.

211
00:09:15,424 --> 00:09:18,514
I didn't want to say this,
but he isn't even that good.

212
00:09:18,688 --> 00:09:21,038
Why would you say
that about your baby?

213
00:09:21,212 --> 00:09:22,736
Are you a stepmother
or something?

214
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,433
- You the real mother?
- Yeah.

215
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:25,607
You shouldn't...

216
00:09:27,175 --> 00:09:28,437
Oh, you know something?

217
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,178
Matter of fact,
Larry, help her out.

218
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,447
- Hey, baby.
- Oh! Hey, girl!

219
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:39,990
I thought we were
goin' to lunch today.

220
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:41,252
You right. We supposed
to have lunch.

221
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:42,494
Yeah, I'm very hungry.

222
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:44,322
I been shoppin' all day.
Look it.

223
00:09:44,496 --> 00:09:46,387
I know. Look, do me a favor, babe.
Just give me a second.

224
00:09:46,411 --> 00:09:47,563
Just go look at some
shoes or something.

225
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,110
Do they got them new RiRis?

226
00:09:49,284 --> 00:09:51,001
RiRis, BeeBees, whoever you
need, it's over there.

227
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:52,959
Do they got 'em? Because,
you know, I do not wanna

228
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,072
be shoppin' unless I can
get them new RiRis.

229
00:09:57,422 --> 00:09:58,422
'Cause she a savage, too.

230
00:09:58,467 --> 00:09:59,507
You a savage and you fine.

231
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:00,556
- I'm fine?
- Yeah.

232
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,949
Well, boy, you better shut up.

233
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:03,559
Over there, look at those RiRis,

234
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,387
you know what I mean?
I see you, boo.

235
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:07,389
- She ready. Yeah!
- She ready.

236
00:10:09,957 --> 00:10:12,742
Oh. Do you see the
RiRis over here?

237
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,788
Yo, my main man, Casper.
What up, brother?

238
00:10:14,962 --> 00:10:16,441
What up, Dax? How
you doin', man?

239
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,443
The myth, the legend
in the makin'.

240
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,228
Hold that thought.

241
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:22,380
Man, I'm confused. I thought
these were out of stock.

242
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:24,841
Bruh, the truck
came this morning

243
00:10:25,015 --> 00:10:26,495
and dropped off a
new stock of shoes.

244
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:27,801
I was gonna call you.

245
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:29,454
So you gonna hook us up, then?

246
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,935
Oh, so you want me to get
shoes for everybody.

247
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:33,110
Everybody.

248
00:10:33,284 --> 00:10:35,156
This dude, and this guy...

249
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,829
If you can't do it, I got
plenty of people that...

250
00:10:36,853 --> 00:10:38,899
I got you. I'mma
take care of you,

251
00:10:39,073 --> 00:10:40,944
and your whole squad.

252
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:43,033
Yeah, okay. Yeah,
that's a lot better.

253
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:44,469
Taxes included.

254
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,689
After I put in my
employee discount,

255
00:10:46,863 --> 00:10:50,040
which will probably
get me fired...

256
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,216
The total is $833.50.

257
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,870
Everybody, it's on Dax.

258
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:56,743
It's on... It's on Dax.
Shoes for all y'all.

259
00:10:56,917 --> 00:10:58,135
Oh, hey, Casper.

260
00:10:58,309 --> 00:10:59,528
Oh, hey, baby, how you doin'?

261
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:01,573
Good, how you doin'?

262
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,334
Oh, baby, that's our
meal ticket right there.

263
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:04,751
Oh, my goodness.

264
00:11:04,925 --> 00:11:07,144
Let me show you what
I found on Zillow.

265
00:11:07,318 --> 00:11:09,756
I found a really
cute brownstone.

266
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,367
Two bedroom, hardwood floors...

267
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,542
Transaction denied.

268
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:15,065
Damn it!

269
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:16,608
- Excuse me, what's goin' on?
- Damn what?

270
00:11:16,632 --> 00:11:17,938
Marty, don't worry about it.

271
00:11:18,112 --> 00:11:19,591
Aw, hell no.

272
00:11:19,766 --> 00:11:21,245
If the money for these shoes

273
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:22,788
that just magically
flew out of here

274
00:11:22,812 --> 00:11:24,074
don't come up in 60 seconds,

275
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:25,815
you and Miss Belly
Out goin' to jail.

276
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:27,269
What the hell you talkin' about?

277
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:29,253
First off, I didn't
do nothin' wrong,

278
00:11:29,427 --> 00:11:30,907
so I ain't goin' to jail.

279
00:11:31,081 --> 00:11:32,363
But thank you for noticin'
that my belly's out.

280
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:32,822
Come here, come here, come here.

281
00:11:32,996 --> 00:11:33,996
What?

282
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,238
That kid that just left here...

283
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:39,568
Mmm-hmm?

284
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:41,067
He's gonna change
our lives forever.

285
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:42,223
50 percent.

286
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,227
I mean, at the most, I
could do 49 percent.

287
00:11:46,401 --> 00:11:47,576
You got 30 seconds, brother!

288
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,752
All right, 50 percent.

289
00:11:49,926 --> 00:11:51,711
Cool!

290
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:54,104
It's nice doin'
business with you, boo.

291
00:11:54,278 --> 00:11:56,933
50 percent. I'm
gettin' 50 percent.

292
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:58,979
Marty, did you hear that?
50 percent.

293
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:03,723
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

294
00:12:05,986 --> 00:12:08,553
Look at this, man. Fresh
off the presses, y'all.

295
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,990
Harlem Money, you see that?

296
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,600
Come on, y'all, look!

297
00:12:11,774 --> 00:12:13,384
Go grab your jersey, come on.

298
00:12:13,558 --> 00:12:15,318
I didn't know you got
money for second place.

299
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,696
Hey, man, what the
hell you doin' here?

300
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,959
Why don't you enlighten
this fool, C-Dawg?

301
00:12:23,133 --> 00:12:24,744
- C-Dawg?
- I'm C-Dawg now.

302
00:12:24,918 --> 00:12:26,354
New team, new nickname.

303
00:12:26,528 --> 00:12:28,269
- Wait, what?
- Wait, what?

304
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:29,923
That's what I said to him.
I was like,

305
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:31,533
"C-Dawg, don't you
wanna be coached

306
00:12:31,707 --> 00:12:33,448
by a dude who looks like an M&M?

307
00:12:33,622 --> 00:12:35,818
What about a dude who looks
straight up like a basketball?

308
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:38,192
Like a Syracuse Orange man."

309
00:12:49,246 --> 00:12:51,466
I've spent my life savings

310
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,424
just to get in this tournament.

311
00:12:53,598 --> 00:12:55,862
I gotta give my girlfriend
half the winnings

312
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:57,820
or she's gonna leave me.

313
00:12:57,994 --> 00:13:02,390
I took three buses and a train
just to pick up those jerseys.

314
00:13:02,564 --> 00:13:04,914
Those Jordans, man! You
know how much that cost me?

315
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:07,177
Yo, by the way, thank
you for the kicks.

316
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:08,613
They are mad expensive.

317
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,228
There was no way I
was gonna buy 'em.

318
00:13:10,354 --> 00:13:11,616
All right, boys, let's roll.

319
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:12,574
Come back here!

320
00:13:12,748 --> 00:13:14,489
Dantay! Other Dantay!

321
00:13:14,663 --> 00:13:16,663
- Casper, take off those shoes.
- I'mma hold these.

322
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,927
You hear me, Casper?

323
00:13:18,101 --> 00:13:21,191
Take off those shoes!

324
00:13:22,236 --> 00:13:23,803
And comin' in at number one

325
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:26,153
onSportsCenter's "Not
Top Ten" list...

326
00:13:26,327 --> 00:13:28,808
With the Rucker 50 right
around the corner,

327
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:30,897
we have a meltdown
from New York City.

328
00:13:31,071 --> 00:13:33,943
I'm told the man you see here
is a coach named Dax Winslow.

329
00:13:34,117 --> 00:13:35,597
And, Dax, the good news is

330
00:13:35,771 --> 00:13:36,293
you're onSportsCenter.
The bad news is...

331
00:13:36,467 --> 00:13:37,817
Dax!

332
00:13:37,991 --> 00:13:39,511
What's up, girl?
What'd I do wrong now?

333
00:13:39,557 --> 00:13:40,994
I have so many questions.

334
00:13:41,168 --> 00:13:42,568
You're rolling around
on the ground,

335
00:13:42,691 --> 00:13:43,711
trying to take
somebody's sneakers

336
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:45,389
off their sweaty feet?

337
00:13:45,563 --> 00:13:47,522
Is this your team? Are
these even your players?

338
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,350
Come on, man!

339
00:13:49,524 --> 00:13:52,657
Dax, this is Rucker, man.
Have some respect.

340
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,355
Damn you, Scott Van Pelt!

341
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:56,139
Give me the shoe, Casper!
Right now!

342
00:13:56,313 --> 00:13:57,682
Flopping around on the
ground like fish.

343
00:13:57,706 --> 00:13:58,770
Everything gonna be
all right, okay?

344
00:13:58,794 --> 00:13:59,534
I'mma figure something out.

345
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:00,970
I can't do this anymore.

346
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:03,407
Excuse me?

347
00:14:03,581 --> 00:14:05,061
Do you think that I'm
countin' on you?

348
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:08,717
'Cause I'm not. No, I
was counting on Casper.

349
00:14:08,891 --> 00:14:11,459
And you lost him. You
can't even do that right.

350
00:14:11,633 --> 00:14:14,592
Go in there, pack your
stuff up, and leave.

351
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:16,206
You can't just kick
me out our house.

352
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:17,857
This is my apartment.

353
00:14:18,031 --> 00:14:20,990
Do you even remember the
last time you paid rent?

354
00:14:21,164 --> 00:14:24,124
Okay, every Taco Tuesday,
who buy the $2 tacos?

355
00:14:24,298 --> 00:14:26,822
Don't nobody care
about no damn tacos!

356
00:14:26,996 --> 00:14:28,215
Okay, I paid the water bill

357
00:14:28,389 --> 00:14:29,825
- that one time.
- Get out my house!

358
00:14:31,392 --> 00:14:33,873
Jess, I ain't got nowhere to go.
You know?

359
00:14:34,047 --> 00:14:37,006
I didn't have no family.
And then I met you.

360
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,792
And you took me in. And
you changed my life.

361
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:45,885
Baby, we in this together.
You're my everything.

362
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:50,585
Please, just let me stay
here and figure things out.

363
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:02,162
Hey! Don't leave
with my bag, fool.

364
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:03,661
Where I'm supposed
to put my stuff?

365
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:05,034
Leave with what you came with!

366
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:07,341
Fine, I'll give you back
your stupid, fake bag.

367
00:15:07,515 --> 00:15:09,909
It's not stupid, you stupid.

368
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,085
My bag is smarter than you!

369
00:15:22,486 --> 00:15:24,010
Give my shoes back!

370
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,187
This is Rucker, man.

371
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:28,801
You're supposed to
have some respect.

372
00:15:28,971 --> 00:15:30,451
You're rolling around
on the ground...

373
00:15:30,494 --> 00:15:31,278
trying to take
somebody's sneakers

374
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:33,106
off their sweaty feet?

375
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:34,910
I know y'all think this is
all fun and games and stuff.

376
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,774
But I used everything I
got on this tournament.

377
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:38,415
Did you get a receipt? Huh?

378
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:40,374
No, man, the money's
non-refundable.

379
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:42,202
That's cold.

380
00:15:42,376 --> 00:15:44,944
This a perfect opportunity
for Dax to meet Uncle Drew!

381
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:50,688
Don't start that in here with
the old and the Uncle Drews.

382
00:15:50,862 --> 00:15:52,710
You're trying to throw a
toothpick in a lumberyard.

383
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:55,215
The man is the greatest
blacktop player

384
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,999
I ever seen in my life.

385
00:15:57,173 --> 00:15:58,542
He's real. I've seen
that boy put up

386
00:15:58,566 --> 00:16:00,002
40 points against
The Destroyers.

387
00:16:00,176 --> 00:16:01,961
Using just his left
hand and his chin.

388
00:16:02,135 --> 00:16:03,745
His other hand, he
had a ham sandwich

389
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:04,920
with extra cheese on it.

390
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:06,791
And mayo. He likes mayonnaise.

391
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,271
Okay, come on, man,

392
00:16:08,445 --> 00:16:09,969
that's just like
talking about Bigfoot.

393
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:11,990
Bigfoot. You can't compare
Bigfoot to Uncle Drew.

394
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:13,537
Son of a bitch used
to date my sister.

395
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:15,278
He used to date my
sister and my mother.

396
00:16:15,452 --> 00:16:16,627
He actually hit

397
00:16:16,801 --> 00:16:18,586
- my eighth grade teacher.
- Ooh!

398
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,912
Ain't none of my business what
that man does in his bedtime.

399
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:22,546
I know he had a foot fetish.

400
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,722
All right. The '60s was a wild time.
Okay? So what?

401
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:27,073
Remember them Buicks?

402
00:16:27,247 --> 00:16:28,726
Everybody had them damn Buicks.

403
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:29,921
You'd ride around, had
them big old back seat.

404
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:31,164
You can't move your hips.

405
00:16:31,338 --> 00:16:32,618
But you can still
move your lips.

406
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,297
Hey, I ain't gonna
go no further.

407
00:16:34,471 --> 00:16:38,171
All you need is some Viagra,
and some dress socks.

408
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:39,911
Ain't have no damn
Viagra back then!

409
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:42,436
You had to get two ice-cream
sticks and a rubber band

410
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:44,916
to make the stuff
stand up like that.

411
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,633
I don't have time for this, man.
I gotta go.

412
00:16:46,657 --> 00:16:47,857
Hey, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Dax,

413
00:16:47,963 --> 00:16:49,660
hold on. Now, look.

414
00:16:49,834 --> 00:16:52,533
You need to go holler at Uncle Drew.
Okay?

415
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:54,578
He's a Zen master of basketball.

416
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:56,189
But you gotta believe.

417
00:16:56,363 --> 00:16:58,147
Hey, look. Maybe he was good.

418
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:01,020
But you think this old man can still ball?
Come on, bruh.

419
00:17:01,194 --> 00:17:03,631
I'm good, man. I gotta
find some players, man.

420
00:17:03,805 --> 00:17:06,460
You'll be sorry, Dax. Don't
do that to yourself.

421
00:17:06,634 --> 00:17:08,940
Get with Drew! Get with Drew!

422
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:46,674
Welcome to the jungle, baby.

423
00:17:46,848 --> 00:17:48,848
Get out of here. Go corner,
corner, corner! Corner!

424
00:17:50,852 --> 00:17:52,212
Over here, over
here, hold on, son!

425
00:17:52,245 --> 00:17:53,550
See, that right there,

426
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:55,422
that's the problem
with your generation.

427
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:58,207
Million dollar move and
a five cent finish.

428
00:17:58,381 --> 00:17:59,556
You haven't made a shot yet.

429
00:17:59,861 --> 00:18:00,861
- Come back!
- Come on!

430
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,344
- I was open.
- I had to shoot it, man,

431
00:18:04,518 --> 00:18:06,694
I've taken out trash that
don't stink as bad as that.

432
00:18:08,609 --> 00:18:10,654
Dr. Naismith would be
rolling in his grave

433
00:18:10,828 --> 00:18:12,371
if he knew what these
bums is up to out here.

434
00:18:12,395 --> 00:18:15,006
You talk a lot of smack
for a geriatric.

435
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:16,680
It's a shame you can't
back any of it up.

436
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:19,185
And who's to say I can't?

437
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,797
All right, then, what's the bet?

438
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:26,061
If you win...

439
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:27,995
I'll leave the park and
I'll never come back.

440
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,630
- Good.
- Real good.

441
00:18:29,804 --> 00:18:31,458
But if I win, you and your crew

442
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:33,653
start playing the game the
way it's meant to be played.

443
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:35,375
Oh, how's that? On
a peach basket?

444
00:18:37,377 --> 00:18:40,815
It's like a perfectly
orchestrated symphony.

445
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:42,338
What?

446
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:46,516
Not any instrument is more
important than another.

447
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,822
And what's in it for you?

448
00:18:47,996 --> 00:18:50,259
Love, youngblood. Only love.

449
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:51,713
What is this dude talking about?

450
00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:53,306
What the hell does
that even mean?

451
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,611
What are you talking about?

452
00:18:54,785 --> 00:18:56,091
Hold my nuts.

453
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:58,267
Hold your nuts?

454
00:18:58,441 --> 00:18:59,766
Hey, J! Look at
this dude out here.

455
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,531
Everybody off the court.

456
00:19:01,705 --> 00:19:03,986
Get off the court, man. Get
your big behind off the court.

457
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,493
Hey, man. Give him the business.

458
00:19:08,016 --> 00:19:09,409
Ball up.

459
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,063
Hey, young fella, you
better watch that.

460
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:16,174
Aren't you gonna get
in your stance?

461
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:17,721
I am in my stance.

462
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:23,379
Don't worry, grandpa.

463
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:25,512
Gonna have you home in
plenty of time for NCIS.

464
00:19:25,686 --> 00:19:27,253
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

465
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:30,473
Hey. For the show I know though,

466
00:19:30,647 --> 00:19:33,259
even a bum ain't as broke
as your jump shot.

467
00:19:33,433 --> 00:19:34,673
- Give it to him, J.
- Prove it.

468
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:36,131
You wanna see it rain?

469
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,176
Let it rain.

470
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,352
Raindrops. 2-0.

471
00:19:41,267 --> 00:19:42,529
Next basket wins it.

472
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:44,463
It's getting to be about
that time, ain't it?

473
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:51,320
Yeah, give it to him.

474
00:19:51,494 --> 00:19:52,930
This game is over.

475
00:20:03,463 --> 00:20:05,183
It's time for you to
change your PIN number.

476
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,422
'Cause you just got robbed.

477
00:20:12,646 --> 00:20:14,474
- Come on back.
- J, come on, son!

478
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:16,103
You want me to tell you
your first mistake

479
00:20:16,127 --> 00:20:17,520
or your second?

480
00:20:17,694 --> 00:20:18,478
What's the matter, you
forgot the score?

481
00:20:18,652 --> 00:20:21,089
One. You got too cocky.

482
00:20:21,263 --> 00:20:22,612
There's a fine line between

483
00:20:22,786 --> 00:20:24,614
confidence and
arrogance, youngblood.

484
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,532
Come on back. Come on back.

485
00:20:29,706 --> 00:20:32,100
And then, two, you're
giving up your lead hip.

486
00:20:32,274 --> 00:20:33,710
You might as well
unlock the door

487
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:37,018
and have your wife show
me where the china is.

488
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:38,846
I wouldn't do that
either if I was you.

489
00:20:40,369 --> 00:20:42,502
Come on, J! No, no!

490
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:46,897
He cookin' your boy.

491
00:20:47,071 --> 00:20:47,855
Man, you need to go back there
and play with them kids, man.

492
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:49,509
I get buckets.

493
00:20:49,683 --> 00:20:51,032
Shut up, old man.

494
00:20:51,206 --> 00:20:52,468
Go on, youngblood.

495
00:20:53,382 --> 00:20:54,470
Check ball.

496
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:57,343
This game is all mental.
All mental.

497
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:04,654
Hand down, man down.

498
00:21:04,828 --> 00:21:06,482
- Anybody got a GPS?
- Come on, J!

499
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:08,776
You know, gonna need a whole
new zip code on that one.

500
00:21:10,704 --> 00:21:12,053
Game point, youngblood.

501
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:13,228
Whatever.

502
00:21:13,794 --> 00:21:14,794
You ready?

503
00:21:15,926 --> 00:21:17,232
Yo, I'll give you that.

504
00:21:17,406 --> 00:21:19,060
Nah. Nah, don't give him that.

505
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:20,670
You still don't believe, do you?

506
00:21:20,844 --> 00:21:22,063
Get your hand up!

507
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:23,557
No, don't give it to him.
Don't...

508
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,633
Don't do him like
that, Uncle Drew!

509
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:28,939
Youngblood.

510
00:21:30,158 --> 00:21:31,159
Good game.

511
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:34,771
Who is that dude?

512
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:37,339
Hey! Hey! Hey!

513
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:38,688
Oh...

514
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:40,516
Oh, my God, man.

515
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,015
That was a pretty amazing
show you put on back there.

516
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,319
It was one of the
greatest things

517
00:21:43,432 --> 00:21:44,955
I've ever seen, honestly.

518
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:46,411
How're you doing?
M-my name is Dax.

519
00:21:46,435 --> 00:21:47,915
I'm not interested.

520
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:49,109
I haven't even told you
what I'm trying to do.

521
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:50,613
Okay, okay.

522
00:21:50,787 --> 00:21:52,199
You can't believe someone
that looks like me

523
00:21:52,223 --> 00:21:53,592
can play like Jordan,
Magic, or Bird.

524
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:54,976
You want to take
advantage of that.

525
00:21:55,052 --> 00:21:56,682
See if you can cash in somehow.
I know your MO.

526
00:21:56,706 --> 00:21:58,273
What? No, no. You got
me all wrong, man.

527
00:21:58,447 --> 00:21:59,468
Look, I just want to talk to you

528
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:00,057
about the Rucker, you know?

529
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:02,495
The Rucker?

530
00:22:02,669 --> 00:22:04,869
You don't know nothing about
no real Rucker, youngblood.

531
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:09,589
Exactly. You right. I
don't know anything

532
00:22:09,763 --> 00:22:11,634
about the Rucker. A
lot of us don't.

533
00:22:11,808 --> 00:22:14,115
But someone like you
could help us, man.

534
00:22:14,289 --> 00:22:15,527
We could combine the old school

535
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:16,813
with the new school, right?

536
00:22:16,987 --> 00:22:18,511
Like a old school,
new school remix.

537
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:20,382
Where you can educate
all the youngbloods

538
00:22:20,556 --> 00:22:22,036
who are lost in
their way, right?

539
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,666
And show 'em what they're
really doing wrong.

540
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,126
You can do that.

541
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,041
Is a lot of lost youngbloods
out there, huh?

542
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:30,044
It is so many lost youngbloods
out here, it is ridiculous.

543
00:22:30,218 --> 00:22:31,567
If I could help them, I would,

544
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:33,153
but I don't know,
because I'm lost, too.

545
00:22:33,177 --> 00:22:35,223
Okay? And that's
why we need you.

546
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:36,548
Look, look, look.
Perfect example.

547
00:22:36,572 --> 00:22:37,921
This is, this is who you are.

548
00:22:38,095 --> 00:22:41,882
You a lonely lighthouse
in a sea of fog.

549
00:22:43,623 --> 00:22:44,928
I actually kind of like that.

550
00:22:45,102 --> 00:22:46,471
- I like that.
- That's good, ain't it?

551
00:22:46,495 --> 00:22:47,516
Yeah, yeah, that's
good, that's good.

552
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,758
That's what I'm telling you.

553
00:22:48,932 --> 00:22:50,717
You are coming to
the rescue, man.

554
00:22:50,891 --> 00:22:52,999
You get a chance to teach this
in front of a bigger audience.

555
00:22:53,023 --> 00:22:55,896
At the Rucker. The Rucker.

556
00:22:57,245 --> 00:22:58,246
Rucker.

557
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,468
The Rucker would be nice.

558
00:23:02,642 --> 00:23:05,732
I'll tell you what. I'll
do it on one condition.

559
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:07,255
Yes!

560
00:23:09,475 --> 00:23:11,999
Anything you want. I don't
care what it is. I got you.

561
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:13,522
It's gotta be my team.

562
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:15,219
My boys.

563
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:17,396
Okay. Anything but that.

564
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:19,136
No. Because it's my team.

565
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:20,660
Yeah, I guess we done here.

566
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:22,488
Dax whatever...

567
00:23:22,662 --> 00:23:24,490
Okay, okay, okay.

568
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:28,537
I'm in, okay? My team.
Your roster.

569
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,235
It's my team, my roster.

570
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:34,108
Look, where you goin'?

571
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:36,240
It's a long drive
to Chocolate City.

572
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,721
Wait, Chocolate City?
What's in D.C.?

573
00:23:38,895 --> 00:23:42,769
Preacher. He's the best power
forward I ever played with.

574
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:44,743
I mean, you don't know
no local power forward?

575
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:46,425
Somebody that stay
in the neighborhood?

576
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:50,690
Here she is. Yeah.

577
00:23:51,473 --> 00:23:52,753
You know, so if
Billy Dee Willams

578
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:54,345
and Diana Ross had a love child,

579
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,240
it would've definitely
been inside this van.

580
00:23:56,391 --> 00:23:57,958
Go on and look way back there.

581
00:23:58,132 --> 00:23:59,849
Go ahead. Take a look. Take
a look way back there.

582
00:23:59,873 --> 00:24:02,179
That right there is
the boom boom room.

583
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:05,356
Boom boom room come
with one rule.

584
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:07,228
No shoes in the boom boom room.

585
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:09,230
So, I could wear shoes

586
00:24:09,404 --> 00:24:11,450
throughout the rest of
the part of this van,

587
00:24:11,624 --> 00:24:13,930
but if I go a couple feet back,

588
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:15,628
I gotta take my shoes off?

589
00:24:15,802 --> 00:24:17,543
Why do I gotta take my
shoes off back there?

590
00:24:17,717 --> 00:24:19,893
And I can leave my shoes
on, like right here?

591
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:21,329
It's the same space.

592
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:22,809
Well, it's the living room,

593
00:24:22,983 --> 00:24:24,680
and then it goes to
the boom boom room.

594
00:24:24,854 --> 00:24:26,854
See, that don't even make
sense because it's a van.

595
00:24:26,943 --> 00:24:28,312
Everything is right
next to each other.

596
00:24:28,336 --> 00:24:29,661
Let's go over the
rest of the rules.

597
00:24:29,685 --> 00:24:30,965
No, but I'm saying that don't...

598
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,690
Hey, don't be slamming my door.

599
00:24:34,864 --> 00:24:36,910
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

600
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:38,191
Hey, man, you just
did the same...

601
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:39,652
Now, let's go over the rules.

602
00:24:39,826 --> 00:24:42,872
One. I'm the pilot.
Means I steer the ship.

603
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:46,441
Two. I'm the weatherman.
I control the heat.

604
00:24:46,615 --> 00:24:47,615
Did you just say heat?

605
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,183
I don't know if you know.

606
00:24:49,357 --> 00:24:50,856
It's the middle of summer,
so maybe you should...

607
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,534
Three. Don't be
questioning one and two.

608
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:54,643
Can't help it if I'm running
a little cold these days.

609
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:57,583
Four, I'm the DJ, which
means I control the music.

610
00:24:57,757 --> 00:25:00,542
Whoo!

611
00:25:00,716 --> 00:25:02,805
What's that? Is that a Game Boy?

612
00:25:02,979 --> 00:25:05,678
- Electronic book?
- Mmm-hmm.

613
00:25:05,852 --> 00:25:07,680
You gonna see.

614
00:25:07,854 --> 00:25:11,466
Oh, yeah! You hear that?
You hear that?

615
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,903
- That's a eight track?
- You hear that?

616
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:16,993
Come on, come on take a ride

617
00:25:17,167 --> 00:25:18,386
That ain't no jive

618
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,083
Can't we just go
to Chocolate City?

619
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:22,782
Don't even have to drive

620
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:23,696
Can you at least
turn down the heat?

621
00:25:23,870 --> 00:25:25,045
Slippity-slide

622
00:25:26,046 --> 00:25:27,047
My glasses are sweating.

623
00:25:27,221 --> 00:25:28,527
Just sail on

624
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,243
That's what I do Just
sail on, that's what I do

625
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:31,897
How you dancing like
that in a jogging suit?

626
00:25:31,921 --> 00:25:32,921
Are you not hot?

627
00:25:34,924 --> 00:25:36,230
I'm really creeped out.

628
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:38,014
Gotta get the boys.

629
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:39,862
I gotta turn up the heat a
little bit though. Yeah.

630
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:41,540
Please don't turn the heat up!

631
00:25:54,248 --> 00:25:55,528
We've been listening
to this song

632
00:25:55,684 --> 00:25:57,425
since this morning.
It is nighttime!

633
00:25:58,948 --> 00:26:00,689
Oh, yeah.

634
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:03,692
- Mmm.
- Ooh!

635
00:26:03,866 --> 00:26:05,389
What you know about this, Drew?

636
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,889
I thought this was gonna
be a boring road trip.

637
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:08,392
You got the classics
playing, man!

638
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,848
What you know about the
classics, youngblood?

639
00:26:09,872 --> 00:26:11,395
I know a lot, man.

640
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:12,938
How did you get Biggie
Smalls on a eight track?

641
00:26:12,962 --> 00:26:15,835
That's crazy, man!
Junior M.A.F.I.A.!

642
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,445
Junior what?

643
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:21,057
You know what I said.
You know who they are.

644
00:26:21,231 --> 00:26:22,798
To all my ladies in the place

645
00:26:22,972 --> 00:26:24,844
With style and grace,
allow me to...

646
00:26:25,018 --> 00:26:26,672
Okay. Okay.

647
00:26:26,846 --> 00:26:28,282
New rule, youngblood.

648
00:26:28,456 --> 00:26:30,284
None of this
rappity-hippity-hop nonsense.

649
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:31,720
You understand?

650
00:26:31,894 --> 00:26:33,374
What you mean
rappity-hippity-hop?

651
00:26:33,548 --> 00:26:34,288
That's not what it's called.
It's called hip-hop.

652
00:26:34,462 --> 00:26:35,985
My car, my version.

653
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,292
Talking about styling.
What is that?

654
00:26:38,466 --> 00:26:39,965
First of all, I can tell
you don't have style.

655
00:26:39,989 --> 00:26:41,401
'Cause you always got
on jogging suits.

656
00:26:41,425 --> 00:26:43,471
Talkin' from the hustler
with the fake chains.

657
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,365
These are real. I got
these for my birthday,

658
00:26:45,473 --> 00:26:46,668
- so go about your business.
- Yeah, right. Those cost...

659
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:47,867
- Three checks!
- Those cost

660
00:26:48,041 --> 00:26:49,409
- fifty cent a piece.
- Three checks!

661
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:50,957
My teeth cost more than that.

662
00:26:51,131 --> 00:26:53,524
This is real music. Now
listen to the words.

663
00:26:53,699 --> 00:26:55,309
At least as far as I can see

664
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:57,006
Oh, yeah.

665
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:01,489
Can see, I want to keep you here

666
00:27:01,663 --> 00:27:03,230
Laying next to me

667
00:27:03,404 --> 00:27:05,338
That's what I tell my girls
in the boom boom room.

668
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:09,062
Love between the sheets

669
00:27:09,236 --> 00:27:10,890
Ooh, this is my favorite part.
Go ahead.

670
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:13,980
- My baby, ooh - Okay.
I'm sorry.

671
00:27:14,154 --> 00:27:16,722
- Baby, baby, my love
- I'm sorry.

672
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:18,506
Stop sing... You're ruining it!

673
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,290
First off. Watch your tone.

674
00:27:20,464 --> 00:27:22,464
Look, here we go. Just listen to it.
Give it a try.

675
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,556
Come on.

676
00:27:25,731 --> 00:27:27,056
You see how quick I did that?
I just pushed play.

677
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,430
I ain't have to take
out an Atari cartridge

678
00:27:29,604 --> 00:27:31,998
- and stuff it in the radio.
- Okay, okay. Pause, pause.

679
00:27:32,172 --> 00:27:33,564
How do you pause it?

680
00:27:34,478 --> 00:27:35,958
Okay, youngblood.

681
00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:38,439
There ain't gonna be
none of that nonsense

682
00:27:38,613 --> 00:27:40,093
here in my car right now.

683
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:41,703
You gonna call this nonsense.

684
00:27:41,877 --> 00:27:43,246
This is one of the
greatest MCs of all time.

685
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,670
Yeah, what about the
Isley Brothers?

686
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:46,292
I don't know too much
of their history,

687
00:27:46,316 --> 00:27:48,076
- but I'll Google it later.
- What is Google?

688
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,419
Hey, man, is this a church?

689
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:04,247
Heck else it's gonna be?

690
00:28:04,421 --> 00:28:06,119
Did we road trip all
the way out here

691
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:07,816
to pick up an actual preacher?

692
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,339
You got a problem with that?

693
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:11,013
No, I don't have a
problem with it, man.

694
00:28:11,037 --> 00:28:12,557
But I thought it was,
like, a nickname,

695
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,571
like "Hot Sauce" or "Crazy
Legs" or "The Glove."

696
00:28:18,044 --> 00:28:20,350
Amen. Amen, Amen.

697
00:28:20,524 --> 00:28:24,180
We're gathered here
today to bear witness

698
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:26,182
to the anointing... Ha!

699
00:28:27,009 --> 00:28:29,272
The christening... Ha!

700
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:31,622
The blessing... Ha!

701
00:28:31,797 --> 00:28:34,147
Of this young rookie soul.

702
00:28:35,844 --> 00:28:39,718
And it is with the
purity of heart we pray

703
00:28:39,892 --> 00:28:42,111
that he will one day grow

704
00:28:42,851 --> 00:28:44,026
to drive the paint...

705
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,636
Why is he holding him like that?

706
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:48,030
Crash the boards of
moral righteousness.

707
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:50,990
No, no, please, no.

708
00:28:51,164 --> 00:28:52,426
My man Kevin Durant started

709
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,080
a new beginning in Golden State.

710
00:28:54,254 --> 00:28:55,472
You preach, Preacher.

711
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:56,865
He's gonna dunk a baby.

712
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,085
One for the money

713
00:29:00,042 --> 00:29:01,783
Two for the show

714
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:04,394
Three to get ready

715
00:29:06,135 --> 00:29:07,658
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

716
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,419
Hey! Man! What are you
doing with that baby, man?

717
00:29:09,443 --> 00:29:11,203
You can't baptize a baby.
You cannot do that.

718
00:29:11,358 --> 00:29:12,838
- You cannot...
- Hey, Dax.

719
00:29:13,012 --> 00:29:13,795
- Dax, sit down.
- Drew, let me go. I got this!

720
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:15,623
That is a baby, okay?

721
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,930
You christen a baby, right?
You hold the baby, right?

722
00:29:18,104 --> 00:29:19,603
Maybe splash a little
water on his face.

723
00:29:19,627 --> 00:29:21,170
He gonna cry a little
bit but no big deal.

724
00:29:21,194 --> 00:29:24,023
You don't dunk a baby
in a baptismal pool.

725
00:29:24,197 --> 00:29:26,112
What type of parents
are y'all to let this

726
00:29:26,286 --> 00:29:28,462
really large man
pick your baby up?

727
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:29,724
He did it like this.

728
00:29:29,898 --> 00:29:31,595
He put your baby
behind his back.

729
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,076
You gonna let this man
Steph Curry your baby?

730
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,250
That's insane!

731
00:29:35,382 --> 00:29:36,557
Uh, maybe the midget's right.

732
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:38,167
Yeah. Can we have our baby back?

733
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:40,561
Is there something I can
help you with, son?

734
00:29:40,735 --> 00:29:42,650
Dax. Give it a break.

735
00:29:42,824 --> 00:29:44,347
- No!
- Sit down!

736
00:29:44,521 --> 00:29:46,108
I'm not sitting down, Drew!
I'm taking a stand.

737
00:29:46,132 --> 00:29:47,176
- All right.
- Thank you.

738
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:48,395
All right, I warned you.

739
00:29:48,569 --> 00:29:50,353
Where you from, son?

740
00:29:50,527 --> 00:29:51,722
I'll tell you where I'm from.
I'm from New York City, okay?

741
00:29:51,746 --> 00:29:53,313
Look here, Tiny Tim.

742
00:29:53,487 --> 00:29:55,924
Took me almost an hour
to fill up that pool.

743
00:29:56,098 --> 00:29:58,231
Somebody's getting
baptized, you understand?

744
00:29:58,405 --> 00:30:00,886
Dunk this potbelly Teletubby!

745
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:02,713
You can't talk to me like that.

746
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:04,019
Y'all wanna baptize him?

747
00:30:04,193 --> 00:30:05,412
- Yeah!
- What?

748
00:30:05,586 --> 00:30:07,109
Bring him on up.

749
00:30:07,283 --> 00:30:09,111
Dunk him like a fat donut.

750
00:30:09,285 --> 00:30:10,828
- Dunk him, Preacher.
- What are you doing, man?

751
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:13,028
- That my boy, Drew.
- Mmm-hmm.

752
00:30:13,202 --> 00:30:15,378
Drew, you gotta make him
take one for the team.

753
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,553
For the team!

754
00:30:16,727 --> 00:30:18,207
No, no, no.

755
00:30:18,381 --> 00:30:20,181
Gonna have to take one for the team.
Oh, yeah.

756
00:30:20,209 --> 00:30:21,732
What you mean, "Take
one for the team"?

757
00:30:24,692 --> 00:30:26,259
Drew,

758
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:29,697
just like back in the day
when we used to hoop,

759
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:32,047
you could still throw
the alley-oop.

760
00:30:32,221 --> 00:30:35,007
Thank you for throwing
me this lost soul.

761
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:03,905
One last run at the Rucker?

762
00:31:04,775 --> 00:31:05,994
Hmm.

763
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:07,648
50th anniversary.

764
00:31:07,822 --> 00:31:11,130
You know this is more
than a 50th anniversary.

765
00:31:11,304 --> 00:31:14,916
This here, divine intervention.

766
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,352
I wouldn't call it all that.

767
00:31:16,526 --> 00:31:17,852
I'm gonna have to run
it by Betty Lou though.

768
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,268
Run what by Betty Lou?

769
00:31:19,442 --> 00:31:20,487
Drew's putting the squad

770
00:31:20,661 --> 00:31:22,228
- back together.
- Yep.

771
00:31:22,402 --> 00:31:24,042
You forget what happened
to you, Preacher,

772
00:31:24,186 --> 00:31:25,884
when you get between them lines?

773
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:28,408
No, no, no. I just
ain't laced 'em up

774
00:31:28,582 --> 00:31:29,844
in a while, that's all.

775
00:31:30,018 --> 00:31:31,585
And there is a reason for that.

776
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:32,759
Quick question.

777
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:34,631
What exactly is "a while"?

778
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:36,285
I mean, is that like
a few weeks or...

779
00:31:36,416 --> 00:31:37,808
30.

780
00:31:37,983 --> 00:31:40,376
- 35 years. Still nice, though.
- 35 years.

781
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:43,858
Wait, 35 years? Come on,
man, that's ridiculous.

782
00:31:44,032 --> 00:31:46,556
Our little hobbit is right.
It's ridiculous.

783
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:49,298
It's God's work that matters now.
Not basketball.

784
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:51,170
Just because it's God's work,

785
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:52,823
don't mean it's not still work.

786
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:54,695
His work is never done.

787
00:31:54,869 --> 00:31:56,229
Now, I've had about
enough of this.

788
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:01,658
Book of Psalms, chapter
62, verse one and two.

789
00:32:01,832 --> 00:32:06,098
Fool, please. Book of Psalms,
chapter 23, verse four.

790
00:32:06,272 --> 00:32:10,537
Ephesians five,
chapter 22, boom!

791
00:32:10,711 --> 00:32:14,541
Book of Betty Lou, chapter
one, verse "I said so."

792
00:32:16,804 --> 00:32:19,328
You heard the woman. I can't go.

793
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:21,417
One, it wasn't no
black hobbits, right?

794
00:32:21,591 --> 00:32:23,593
And, two, that is one
mean churchwoman.

795
00:32:23,767 --> 00:32:25,310
She ain't supposed to be
calling me ugly like that.

796
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:26,596
Okay, and I'm handsome.

797
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,170
I'm the short version
of Idris Elba.

798
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:29,607
The ladies say it
all the time, man.

799
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:30,949
And is he even coming?

800
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:32,733
- He's coming.
- How do you know?

801
00:32:32,907 --> 00:32:35,431
Basketball is in his blood.
Same as it is in mine.

802
00:32:35,605 --> 00:32:37,085
Both of y'all old as hell, okay?

803
00:32:37,259 --> 00:32:38,579
And I at least saw
you play first.

804
00:32:38,608 --> 00:32:39,958
I need to see him
shoot at least.

805
00:32:40,132 --> 00:32:41,742
Youngblood, you can't
teach seven feet.

806
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,415
What you mean you can't
teach seven feet?

807
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:44,959
- What are you talking...
- Hallelujah!

808
00:32:45,093 --> 00:32:47,400
Man can only take
so much nagging

809
00:32:47,574 --> 00:32:48,792
before he done had enough.

810
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,359
I told ya.

811
00:32:50,533 --> 00:32:51,641
He could have got in
here without yelling

812
00:32:51,665 --> 00:32:53,362
"Hallelujah" in my ear, right?

813
00:32:53,536 --> 00:32:55,340
Preacher, you're supposed
to take your shoes off

814
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:56,975
in the boom boom room.

815
00:32:57,149 --> 00:32:58,865
You're gonna tell me the
rules of the boom boom room?

816
00:32:58,889 --> 00:33:00,969
I'm just trying to make sure
we're clear, that's all.

817
00:33:01,022 --> 00:33:02,415
Oh, Lord.

818
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:04,417
Spoke too soon.

819
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:09,161
Why are we slowing down?

820
00:33:09,335 --> 00:33:10,945
Light just turned red.

821
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:13,382
So? Run it, fool! You know
how worked up she can get.

822
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:15,341
Oh, no, I ain't trying
to get no ticket now.

823
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,651
Preacher!

824
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:23,871
I know you in that van!

825
00:33:24,045 --> 00:33:25,645
She got a baseball bat
in a church dress?

826
00:33:31,487 --> 00:33:32,880
I am Betty to the Lou.

827
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:35,230
They don't even know
who they messing with.

828
00:33:35,404 --> 00:33:36,536
Don't you know any players

829
00:33:36,710 --> 00:33:38,103
that don't require a road trip?

830
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:39,017
And what's the deal
with Betty Lou anyway?

831
00:33:39,191 --> 00:33:40,409
It's just one weekend.

832
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:42,281
Is it me? Or is
it nippy in here?

833
00:33:42,455 --> 00:33:44,065
It ain't just you.

834
00:33:44,239 --> 00:33:46,043
What is wrong with you two?
I am melting over here.

835
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:48,765
Good. Looks like you could
stand to lose a few.

836
00:33:48,939 --> 00:33:50,506
Is it just me, or is
little man's head

837
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,726
abnormally large for his body?

838
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,337
Hey, youngblood, how much does
your neck hate your head?

839
00:33:55,511 --> 00:33:57,339
- Big head, little neck.
- Funny jokes.

840
00:33:57,513 --> 00:33:58,862
He was a baby bobblehead doll.

841
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,473
Wobble, wobble, wobble.

842
00:34:00,647 --> 00:34:02,953
Actually, my head is the
most normalest size

843
00:34:03,128 --> 00:34:04,670
you could think of.
I've measured my head.

844
00:34:04,694 --> 00:34:06,914
Well, you sure got some
little ass ears then.

845
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:10,265
Mama deserve a purple heart,
passin' a melon that big.

846
00:34:12,006 --> 00:34:13,790
Anybody else use a disco nap?

847
00:34:13,964 --> 00:34:16,402
See, now that is a
good idea, Preacher.

848
00:34:16,576 --> 00:34:18,491
My eyelids been heavy all day.

849
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:27,761
Seriously?

850
00:34:29,632 --> 00:34:31,547
These two are unbelievable.

851
00:34:32,113 --> 00:34:33,113
You good?

852
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:34,768
All set.

853
00:34:34,942 --> 00:34:36,639
Still a little nippy
in here though.

854
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:38,380
That's strike two, youngblood.

855
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:40,426
The next one, you gonna
be riding on the roof.

856
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,254
Not with that big
ass head, he can't.

857
00:34:42,428 --> 00:34:44,299
Too much wind resistance.

858
00:35:09,281 --> 00:35:10,847
Hey, Preacher, can I
ask you a question?

859
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,980
Can I say no?

860
00:35:13,154 --> 00:35:14,392
What happened to y'all
back in the day, man?

861
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:15,983
Why did all y'all disappear?

862
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,419
Gotta ask him that.

863
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:20,770
So, Drew, what happened in 1968?

864
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:23,382
Nothing a few Ws can't fix.

865
00:35:23,556 --> 00:35:25,514
You really think
basketball could fix

866
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:27,473
what happened with
you and Big Fella?

867
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:28,822
Why not?

868
00:35:30,476 --> 00:35:32,565
Play the game the right
way, it fixes everything.

869
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:35,307
You say so.

870
00:35:37,396 --> 00:35:39,702
Come on, man. Okay, could
you get a jug or something?

871
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,839
You really love
basketball, don't you?

872
00:35:47,754 --> 00:35:49,756
What's there not to love?

873
00:35:49,930 --> 00:35:52,324
Basketball's the most
reliable thing in the world.

874
00:35:53,455 --> 00:35:56,763
Don't complain, don't
ask any questions.

875
00:35:56,937 --> 00:36:00,070
You bounce it, comes
right back up.

876
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:03,451
What about you, youngblood?
You ever play?

877
00:36:05,554 --> 00:36:06,555
Nah, not really.

878
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:08,035
Why not?

879
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:10,211
'Cause I don't.

880
00:36:10,385 --> 00:36:11,995
What's that supposed to mean?

881
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,215
It means what I said, okay?
I just coach, all right?

882
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:16,478
- I don't believe you.
- I don't play, okay?

883
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:20,221
All right. Well, you're up.

884
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:21,764
Wait a minute, I thought
you was the pilot.

885
00:36:21,788 --> 00:36:23,224
I need you to
co-pilot for a spell.

886
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:24,965
Address is on the dash.

887
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,360
Don't mess up my car.

888
00:36:28,534 --> 00:36:30,405
Aw, snap!

889
00:36:30,579 --> 00:36:32,451
Prostate ain't what
it used to be.

890
00:36:32,625 --> 00:36:34,453
How many times you gonna
use the bathroom?

891
00:36:34,627 --> 00:36:38,457
Jesus, man. Need like a
built-in toilet in his shorts.

892
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:41,590
Now, please enjoy the
latest in sports.

893
00:36:41,764 --> 00:36:43,026
Let's go to Rucker Park

894
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,463
where our man, Scoop Jackson

895
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:46,517
is interviewing seven-time
winner, Mookie Bass.

896
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,249
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

897
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:49,966
Scoop Jackson at the
Rucker 50, Harlem, USA.

898
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,470
Here with my man, Mookie Bass.

899
00:36:51,644 --> 00:36:53,385
- Damn, Mookie.
- So, why do you keep

900
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,710
doing this, man? You have
a history of just winnin'

901
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:55,885
and winnin' and winnin' this.

902
00:36:55,909 --> 00:36:57,606
When is it ever gonna stop?

903
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,620
Hey, that's a great question, Scoop.
It's like,

904
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:00,759
"What keeps you motivated?"
You know what I mean?

905
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:02,220
And for me, it's a rivalry.

906
00:37:02,394 --> 00:37:04,700
Its power is derived
from rivalry, you know?

907
00:37:04,874 --> 00:37:06,702
-Seriously? -What is
your source of power?

908
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:10,010
When Thomas Jefferson sent
car keys up in the sky,

909
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:11,490
and then it got
hit by lightning,

910
00:37:11,664 --> 00:37:12,969
and that started the first car.

911
00:37:13,143 --> 00:37:14,841
This don't even make sense.

912
00:37:15,015 --> 00:37:16,862
Now, I'm no scientist, so
don't quote me on this.

913
00:37:16,886 --> 00:37:19,324
Although I do have a degree
from Trump University.

914
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:23,153
But every power has a
source for that power.

915
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,155
So, what's your source, then?

916
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,854
He know who he is and we'll
just leave it at that.

917
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:30,073
Bam!

918
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,119
Shoutout to Pepsi.
Shoutout to Oberto.

919
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:33,990
Shoutout to Aleve,

920
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:35,620
the number one painkiller
in the game right now.

921
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:36,644
And there it is.

922
00:37:36,732 --> 00:37:38,256
I'mma just get out of here.

923
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,301
Rucker 50, Tournament
of Champions,

924
00:37:40,475 --> 00:37:42,192
all going down in three days,
here in Harlem. Three days.

925
00:37:42,216 --> 00:37:43,739
I'm coming.

926
00:37:43,913 --> 00:37:45,193
Three days, you going down, Dix.

927
00:37:51,530 --> 00:37:52,922
Damn, there's a lot of trees.

928
00:37:53,096 --> 00:37:54,770
Hey, man, you're not
kidnapping me, are you?

929
00:37:54,794 --> 00:37:56,448
I'm serious. I saw
the movieGet Out.

930
00:37:56,622 --> 00:37:58,062
The only reason I'm
still in this van

931
00:37:58,232 --> 00:38:00,392
'cause you're a old black man.
But if you was white...

932
00:38:02,584 --> 00:38:04,024
Drew, could you tell
your girlfriends

933
00:38:04,107 --> 00:38:05,195
to get across the street?

934
00:38:13,595 --> 00:38:15,155
Something I can help
you gentlemen with?

935
00:38:16,337 --> 00:38:18,252
Looking for an old friend.

936
00:38:18,426 --> 00:38:20,254
First name, Wilbur,
last name, Wallace.

937
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:22,212
You mean, Lights?

938
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:23,910
Check the D&B across the street.

939
00:38:24,084 --> 00:38:26,216
He likes to get his
shots up before lunch.

940
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:28,306
Yeah, that is Lights.

941
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,587
See, that's what I
am talking about.

942
00:38:29,611 --> 00:38:31,047
Somebody actually practicing.

943
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:35,530
Oh!

944
00:38:35,704 --> 00:38:37,489
Yeah, that's it.

945
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:39,360
- Swish!
- Oh, that was all net.

946
00:38:42,102 --> 00:38:44,060
- Good job.
- Boom, baby!

947
00:38:46,062 --> 00:38:47,542
Buckets.

948
00:38:47,716 --> 00:38:49,588
Girl, you should've seen
me back in the day.

949
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:51,633
Whoo-hoo!

950
00:38:51,807 --> 00:38:53,200
Well, how'd I do?

951
00:38:53,374 --> 00:38:54,917
It's the highest score
of the year, Lights.

952
00:38:54,941 --> 00:38:56,048
That means you buying
drinks, right?

953
00:38:56,072 --> 00:38:57,136
That's exactly what that means.

954
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,771
Means she's too nice to tell

955
00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:01,426
a old turkey like
yourself the truth.

956
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,644
Wait a minute.

957
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:04,385
Drew!

958
00:39:04,559 --> 00:39:06,605
- Lights.
- Drew!

959
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:07,954
What's going on, man?

960
00:39:08,128 --> 00:39:09,323
I'm right here, I'm right here.

961
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,173
What's going on?

962
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,566
Okay, now.

963
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,133
How's the release?

964
00:39:13,307 --> 00:39:15,135
Oh, come on, Drew. Just
get me to my spot.

965
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:16,963
Once a shooter,
always a shooter.

966
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:19,115
What do you mean, "Once a
shooter, always a shooter"?

967
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:20,706
This dude shot
nothin' but bricks.

968
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,710
Damn, Preach. I didn't
even notice you over here.

969
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:26,538
Who else did you
roll in here with?

970
00:39:26,712 --> 00:39:28,278
He's right there.

971
00:39:28,453 --> 00:39:29,691
Hey, man. Brother! Okay,
this is my personal space.

972
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:30,977
Sorry.

973
00:39:31,151 --> 00:39:32,587
Now, I got a question, because

974
00:39:32,761 --> 00:39:34,086
I've been seeing a lot
since I've been here.

975
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:35,110
Are you blind?

976
00:39:35,242 --> 00:39:36,983
Legally or actually?

977
00:39:37,157 --> 00:39:39,289
That don't even make any...
You know something?

978
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:41,422
I'mma... I'mma chill out.

979
00:39:41,596 --> 00:39:43,196
Drew, can I talk to
you for five seconds?

980
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,078
Yeah, yeah. You chill out.

981
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:46,906
Trying to find my boy, Boots.

982
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,778
Oh, I'm Maya. Boots
is my grandfather.

983
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:52,912
Oh. Boots. Great
to meet you, Maya.

984
00:39:53,086 --> 00:39:54,435
Where's the little
shrimp, anyway?

985
00:39:55,349 --> 00:39:57,917
Not good, Drew. Not good.

986
00:40:00,267 --> 00:40:01,355
Grandpa.

987
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:05,533
Grandpa, you have some
friends here to see you.

988
00:40:08,101 --> 00:40:09,711
Right over there.
You want to say hi?

989
00:40:22,855 --> 00:40:24,204
Heads up, little man.

990
00:40:24,378 --> 00:40:26,511
Yeah. O.G.

991
00:40:26,685 --> 00:40:28,687
- He still got it.
- Yeah.

992
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,602
There he is.

993
00:40:30,776 --> 00:40:33,343
How you doing, Boots? Ah, man.

994
00:40:35,911 --> 00:40:37,826
Band back together, huh?

995
00:40:39,698 --> 00:40:41,308
Nah, I love you, too, bro.

996
00:40:41,482 --> 00:40:43,702
It's good to see you now.

997
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:46,574
Hey, little lady,
everything okay?

998
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:48,588
It's just been years since
he smiled like that,

999
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,709
and even longer since
he tried to stand.

1000
00:40:50,883 --> 00:40:53,842
Excuse me. You said this man
hasn't walked in years?

1001
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,540
Yeah. A lot of years.

1002
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:57,126
Look here, Drew. I ain't
trying to break up

1003
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,519
your bromance,
brother, but, come on.

1004
00:40:58,543 --> 00:40:59,935
It's no time for
that, youngblood.

1005
00:41:00,109 --> 00:41:01,783
Gotta get Boots here
packed and ready to go.

1006
00:41:01,807 --> 00:41:04,331
I'm sorry. Packed for what
and ready to go where?

1007
00:41:04,505 --> 00:41:05,787
You didn't think
that we was gonna

1008
00:41:05,811 --> 00:41:07,091
leave here without him, did you?

1009
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:08,683
Okay, look, Drew, right?

1010
00:41:08,857 --> 00:41:10,511
- Uncle Drew.
- Uncle Drew.

1011
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:12,805
Can I just talk to you for a
second over here, please?

1012
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:14,752
Okay, here's the deal.
I am all for him

1013
00:41:14,776 --> 00:41:16,212
getting a break from this place

1014
00:41:16,386 --> 00:41:18,106
'cause, quite frankly,
I could use one, too.

1015
00:41:18,258 --> 00:41:21,870
But his doctors have him on a
full psychiatric lockdown.

1016
00:41:22,044 --> 00:41:23,829
So, that means no trips.

1017
00:41:24,003 --> 00:41:25,154
Just means we gotta
break him out.

1018
00:41:25,178 --> 00:41:26,614
No, that's illegal.

1019
00:41:26,788 --> 00:41:28,747
Break out? Do you
even hear yourself?

1020
00:41:28,921 --> 00:41:30,313
You are insane!

1021
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,168
You're the coach, ain't you?
Figure it out.

1022
00:41:33,752 --> 00:41:35,425
Now, look, everybody.
Just like on the court,

1023
00:41:35,449 --> 00:41:37,277
- it's all about timing.
- Okay.

1024
00:41:37,451 --> 00:41:38,844
And I got the plan. Here we go.

1025
00:41:39,018 --> 00:41:40,698
Lights, I need you to
go in, and I need you

1026
00:41:40,759 --> 00:41:42,848
to distract these
nurses here and here.

1027
00:41:43,022 --> 00:41:44,414
Once that happens, Preacher,

1028
00:41:44,589 --> 00:41:46,765
I need you to go in and penetrate.
Right?

1029
00:41:46,939 --> 00:41:48,979
All the way to the psych
ward and set a back pick...

1030
00:41:49,115 --> 00:41:50,527
- What is a back pick?
- On the security guard.

1031
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:51,833
But make sure you do
that, a good pick.

1032
00:41:51,857 --> 00:41:53,423
A good forward does a good pick,

1033
00:41:53,598 --> 00:41:55,164
and that's what I
need you to do.

1034
00:41:55,338 --> 00:41:56,925
Once that happens, Drew,
you're my all-star, brother.

1035
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:58,341
I need you to sneak in there,

1036
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,648
right, and get Boots
undiscreetly...

1037
00:42:00,822 --> 00:42:02,084
- Undiscreetly?
- Take him to

1038
00:42:02,258 --> 00:42:03,366
the freight elevator all
the way to the roof.

1039
00:42:03,390 --> 00:42:04,913
You know he's in a wheelchair?

1040
00:42:05,087 --> 00:42:06,151
Once you get to the roof,
guess who's there? Me.

1041
00:42:06,175 --> 00:42:07,437
Your boy. I'mma have a rope...

1042
00:42:07,612 --> 00:42:08,937
- Rope?
- What do we do with that rope?

1043
00:42:08,961 --> 00:42:10,416
We tie the rope securely
on the wheelchair.

1044
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,659
We will lower him down

1045
00:42:11,833 --> 00:42:13,313
- nice and slow...
- Whoa, lower?

1046
00:42:13,487 --> 00:42:14,619
Until...

1047
00:42:15,402 --> 00:42:17,360
Who is it?

1048
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,058
You know, I don't
mind you being here,

1049
00:42:19,232 --> 00:42:20,755
but I had to draw all this up

1050
00:42:20,929 --> 00:42:22,670
for you just to roll
down here on your own?

1051
00:42:22,844 --> 00:42:24,280
Look, just get in the van.

1052
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,810
Pure magic.

1053
00:42:35,248 --> 00:42:37,206
Think I don't know what
you're up to, little man?

1054
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,730
You think you're
slick, don't you?

1055
00:42:38,904 --> 00:42:41,167
This ain't nothing but
a full-court press.

1056
00:42:41,994 --> 00:42:44,562
I'll just take your rook, boom!

1057
00:42:50,219 --> 00:42:53,048
Hold up. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1058
00:42:53,222 --> 00:42:54,615
Run that back, man.

1059
00:42:54,789 --> 00:42:55,897
Run that back. Double
or nothing this time.

1060
00:42:55,921 --> 00:42:57,662
Double or nothing this time.

1061
00:42:57,836 --> 00:42:59,316
So, you sure you
really wanna do this?

1062
00:42:59,446 --> 00:43:01,056
You know, this van is
full of old people,

1063
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,276
and it's already smelling
like pee and Poligrip.

1064
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:08,063
That is true. But I wanna see
my grandpa happy, you know?

1065
00:43:08,237 --> 00:43:09,761
Why do they call
your grandpa Boots?

1066
00:43:09,935 --> 00:43:11,240
Well, it's an interesting story.

1067
00:43:11,414 --> 00:43:12,914
He wore the same worn
out pair of kicks

1068
00:43:12,938 --> 00:43:14,306
every time he stepped
foot on the court.

1069
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:15,941
He refused to play
in anything else.

1070
00:43:16,115 --> 00:43:18,857
He would tell people that
they were his work boots.

1071
00:43:19,988 --> 00:43:21,183
You know, I think
it's really sweet

1072
00:43:21,207 --> 00:43:22,861
what you're doing for them.

1073
00:43:23,035 --> 00:43:25,080
We all need something
to look forward to,

1074
00:43:25,254 --> 00:43:26,995
even if it is just a pipe dream.

1075
00:43:27,169 --> 00:43:30,172
What do you mean, pipe dream?
Uncle Drew is the real deal.

1076
00:43:30,346 --> 00:43:32,627
Yeah, but you don't actually
think they could win, do you?

1077
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,220
I mean, that's what
makes it so sweet,

1078
00:43:34,394 --> 00:43:36,135
is that you're doing it anyway.

1079
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:37,527
You're basically just setting

1080
00:43:37,702 --> 00:43:40,530
$5,000 on fire to
see them happy.

1081
00:43:42,837 --> 00:43:45,535
If you ask me,
that's pretty noble.

1082
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:49,670
Exactly who I am, you know?
Dax the Noble.

1083
00:43:53,326 --> 00:43:56,068
We got a blind guy, a guy
who can't even walk,

1084
00:43:56,242 --> 00:43:58,592
and a preacher who still
keep a perm in his head.

1085
00:43:58,766 --> 00:44:00,115
What's wrong with this next guy?

1086
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:01,595
You wanna tell him or should we?

1087
00:44:01,769 --> 00:44:03,075
Tell me what?

1088
00:44:03,249 --> 00:44:04,642
Don't even worry about it.

1089
00:44:04,816 --> 00:44:06,513
Oh. Sure you don't want
us to go with you?

1090
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:09,603
Some songs are best sung solo.

1091
00:44:09,777 --> 00:44:12,737
Dibs on the van if he
actually kills you.

1092
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,005
Hold stance.

1093
00:44:29,057 --> 00:44:31,059
Remember, my young grasshoppers,

1094
00:44:31,233 --> 00:44:32,757
without the proper focus,

1095
00:44:32,931 --> 00:44:34,771
you will never truly
master your mind and body.

1096
00:44:34,933 --> 00:44:36,064
Yes, Sifu.

1097
00:44:38,806 --> 00:44:40,460
It is also important
to remember,

1098
00:44:40,634 --> 00:44:44,029
without a good defense,
your offense means nothing.

1099
00:44:44,203 --> 00:44:46,335
Yes, Sifu.

1100
00:44:46,509 --> 00:44:49,251
Now, go in peace.
Get out of here.

1101
00:44:56,606 --> 00:44:59,044
Look like a scene out
of Game of Death.

1102
00:44:59,218 --> 00:45:01,394
All these years, and you
still ain't figured out

1103
00:45:01,568 --> 00:45:04,179
that the best defense
is good offense, huh?

1104
00:45:04,353 --> 00:45:05,633
It's good to see you, Big Fella.

1105
00:45:07,095 --> 00:45:08,203
- Oh, my God, they're fighting.
- What happened?

1106
00:45:08,227 --> 00:45:09,227
- Okay.
- Go get him.

1107
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:10,316
Drew got knocked out, man.

1108
00:45:11,926 --> 00:45:13,232
I got to be the getaway driver.

1109
00:45:13,406 --> 00:45:15,451
I brought my driving gloves.

1110
00:45:15,625 --> 00:45:16,801
That dude is a giant.

1111
00:45:16,975 --> 00:45:19,325
Best drop step in the business.

1112
00:45:21,022 --> 00:45:23,372
Sup, Big Fella?

1113
00:45:23,546 --> 00:45:25,810
That sucker punch is the first
free throw you ever made.

1114
00:45:30,075 --> 00:45:31,772
Putting the team back together.

1115
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:34,340
I can't do that unless
you're on board.

1116
00:45:34,514 --> 00:45:36,646
How about we play
one-on-one for it?

1117
00:45:36,821 --> 00:45:40,302
Can't always play your
way out your problems.

1118
00:45:40,476 --> 00:45:41,956
It's worked out
pretty good so far.

1119
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,784
- Has it though?
- Okay, okay. Hey, hey.

1120
00:45:43,958 --> 00:45:44,958
Time out!

1121
00:45:45,046 --> 00:45:46,526
Large karate man, excuse me.

1122
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:49,050
You look like Wolverine's
grandfather.

1123
00:45:49,224 --> 00:45:50,984
That's none of my business,
that's your look.

1124
00:45:51,052 --> 00:45:54,055
Okay, I get it. Uncle
Drew is annoying.

1125
00:45:54,229 --> 00:45:57,232
He's been getting on my
nerves for the last few days.

1126
00:45:57,406 --> 00:45:59,539
So, you don't have to do
this for him, that's cool.

1127
00:45:59,713 --> 00:46:01,193
But what about the
rest of these cats?

1128
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:03,064
One last time around
the block, Big Fella.

1129
00:46:03,238 --> 00:46:04,238
What about Lights?

1130
00:46:04,283 --> 00:46:05,414
In the van with Boots.

1131
00:46:05,588 --> 00:46:06,588
Boots?

1132
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:15,773
I'll sweeten the deal for you.

1133
00:46:15,947 --> 00:46:17,775
You can do whatever
you want to this man.

1134
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:19,428
- Wait, what?
- You can slap him,

1135
00:46:19,602 --> 00:46:21,953
you could karate chop him,
you can nunchuck him.

1136
00:46:22,127 --> 00:46:23,693
Knock him out again, kick him.

1137
00:46:23,868 --> 00:46:27,045
Okay, you can have a step
show on his old ass body.

1138
00:46:27,219 --> 00:46:29,699
I don't care. But come
play with us, man.

1139
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:32,006
Come on, man.

1140
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,450
I mean, what does that mean in kung fu?
Is that a yes?

1141
00:46:41,624 --> 00:46:43,148
Yeah, he's coming.

1142
00:46:43,322 --> 00:46:46,281
Yes. We got a giant on our team!

1143
00:46:46,455 --> 00:46:48,631
And I hope he can
play basketball.

1144
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,329
Hey, man, what are
you doing, man?

1145
00:46:50,503 --> 00:46:51,697
You ain't supposed to
be behind the wheel.

1146
00:46:51,721 --> 00:46:53,027
I'm the getaway driver.

1147
00:46:53,201 --> 00:46:54,526
What you mean, you
the getaway driver?

1148
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:55,638
Dude, we ain't rob a bank.

1149
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,249
I got this, young
fella, I got this.

1150
00:46:57,423 --> 00:46:58,859
Oh, come on now, Lights,

1151
00:46:59,033 --> 00:47:00,271
you know you're not
supposed to be driving.

1152
00:47:00,295 --> 00:47:01,993
Come on, man. Not
even a block or two?

1153
00:47:02,167 --> 00:47:03,951
No, no, you can't drive.

1154
00:47:06,475 --> 00:47:07,650
Is that who I think it is?

1155
00:47:10,653 --> 00:47:12,481
Where the hell she come from?

1156
00:47:12,655 --> 00:47:14,657
- What's happening? What?
- Betty Lou is happening.

1157
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,032
- Come on.
- Why are we scared?

1158
00:47:16,181 --> 00:47:17,621
- Who is Betty Lou?
- That's my wife.

1159
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,140
I wasn't supposed
to leave the house.

1160
00:47:19,314 --> 00:47:21,031
Come on, Lights. You gotta
get out the car now.

1161
00:47:21,055 --> 00:47:22,895
- Drew, it's stuck.
- Wait, where is Big Fella?

1162
00:47:23,057 --> 00:47:24,232
Come on, we gotta move.

1163
00:47:24,406 --> 00:47:25,686
Shut up, I'm not talking to you.

1164
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,123
Come on now, Betty Lou's coming.

1165
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:28,584
- Who?
- Betty Lou's coming.

1166
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:31,022
I'm gonna kill him.

1167
00:47:31,196 --> 00:47:32,695
Lights, don't worry
about the seat belt.

1168
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:34,416
- I can drive?
- Gas it before she kill us!

1169
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:35,611
Not a scratch, you hear me?

1170
00:47:35,635 --> 00:47:36,679
I got you, Drew.

1171
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:42,163
- Buckle up.
- Punch it, fool!

1172
00:47:42,337 --> 00:47:43,512
Whoo-hoo!

1173
00:47:43,686 --> 00:47:44,949
You're going the wrong way!

1174
00:47:45,123 --> 00:47:46,776
You're going in reverse!

1175
00:47:46,951 --> 00:47:49,344
Lights, turn, turn!

1176
00:47:51,564 --> 00:47:53,305
Lights!

1177
00:47:53,479 --> 00:47:54,741
One voice, all right?

1178
00:47:54,915 --> 00:47:56,786
Ears can't take all
that hollering.

1179
00:47:59,354 --> 00:48:01,356
Incoming!

1180
00:48:03,968 --> 00:48:05,815
You got a old pickup to your left.
Just curl around it

1181
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:07,279
like you're jumping
off to your spot.

1182
00:48:11,758 --> 00:48:12,758
Brace for impact!

1183
00:48:17,503 --> 00:48:18,939
Jesus, take the wheel.

1184
00:48:19,113 --> 00:48:20,593
- Pull over!
- No!

1185
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:22,725
You don't know who you're
messing with, hobbit!

1186
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,727
I'm not a hobbit, lady!
I'm a man!

1187
00:48:27,426 --> 00:48:29,384
Hit the freeway! She won't
drive on no highway!

1188
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:31,473
Spin it to win it.

1189
00:48:31,647 --> 00:48:33,171
What?

1190
00:48:45,748 --> 00:48:47,446
Oh, y'all want me
to keep driving?

1191
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:49,100
No!

1192
00:48:49,274 --> 00:48:51,015
I thought I did okay myself.

1193
00:49:01,112 --> 00:49:02,417
Here goes nothing.

1194
00:49:16,779 --> 00:49:19,260
Let's go, ladies. On the bus.
On the bus.

1195
00:49:19,434 --> 00:49:21,088
Hey, hey, Coach. Excuse me.

1196
00:49:21,262 --> 00:49:22,862
How you doin', man?
Dax Winslow, brother.

1197
00:49:23,003 --> 00:49:24,526
Are these girls just
wearing uniforms

1198
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:26,833
just to be wearing them?
Or are they any good?

1199
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:29,705
You're not from
around here, are you?

1200
00:49:29,879 --> 00:49:32,882
Two time, back-to-back
state champions.

1201
00:49:33,057 --> 00:49:34,754
I got $100 that say my guys

1202
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:38,062
right here could destroy
these prom queens.

1203
00:49:38,236 --> 00:49:40,499
You got life insurance
policies on these guys, right?

1204
00:49:40,673 --> 00:49:43,023
Hopefully, you got their
parents' permission.

1205
00:49:43,197 --> 00:49:46,200
It would be impolite of
me not to take your bet.

1206
00:49:46,896 --> 00:49:49,160
- $100, man.
- Sold.

1207
00:49:49,334 --> 00:49:51,510
Look, guys, we need
to practice, okay?

1208
00:49:51,684 --> 00:49:53,599
What do you mean? Right now?

1209
00:49:53,773 --> 00:49:55,577
Look, this might be the
only opportunity we get.

1210
00:49:55,601 --> 00:49:56,950
What about Grandpa?

1211
00:49:57,124 --> 00:49:58,734
You know he can't
actually play, right?

1212
00:49:58,908 --> 00:50:00,538
Yeah, I figured the little
hobbit could take his spot.

1213
00:50:00,562 --> 00:50:02,608
Look here, Papa Smurf, okay?
Nobody asked you.

1214
00:50:02,782 --> 00:50:04,325
And, look, if we just gotta
play with four people,

1215
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:05,872
then we'll do just four-on-four.

1216
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:08,962
We got one day, one damn
day, until the Rucker.

1217
00:50:09,136 --> 00:50:12,096
We need to be prepared.
Meet me outside, guys.

1218
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:13,836
Come on, Big Fella.

1219
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,534
Let's go, Trojans.
Match up, now.

1220
00:50:18,102 --> 00:50:19,538
Pass the ball.

1221
00:50:19,712 --> 00:50:21,496
I'm open! Pass the ball!

1222
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:23,237
Yeah, Preach.

1223
00:50:23,411 --> 00:50:24,195
Oh, yeah.

1224
00:50:24,369 --> 00:50:25,718
Make it rain!

1225
00:50:25,892 --> 00:50:27,633
That's a ladies' ball.

1226
00:50:28,634 --> 00:50:29,634
I'm open.

1227
00:50:33,247 --> 00:50:34,379
Come on.

1228
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:38,773
Wait a minute.

1229
00:50:40,428 --> 00:50:41,821
Come on, guys, come on!

1230
00:50:41,995 --> 00:50:43,823
- Get down.
- Pass the ball.

1231
00:50:43,997 --> 00:50:47,000
- Hurry up!
- Move those old bodies!

1232
00:50:47,174 --> 00:50:48,306
Let me get some of that.

1233
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:50,569
Wave me over. Match up.

1234
00:50:50,743 --> 00:50:52,223
Up top, up top.

1235
00:50:52,397 --> 00:50:53,920
Oh, this is bringing
back memories now!

1236
00:50:54,399 --> 00:50:56,401
- Got this.
- Goddamn!

1237
00:50:56,575 --> 00:50:57,575
Big Fella!

1238
00:50:58,142 --> 00:50:59,143
You mother...

1239
00:51:01,841 --> 00:51:03,384
Not exactly what you
were expecting, huh?

1240
00:51:03,408 --> 00:51:04,670
No, they are garbage.

1241
00:51:04,844 --> 00:51:06,367
Yeah, but they're smiling.

1242
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:08,804
I mean, that's gotta count
for something, right?

1243
00:51:08,978 --> 00:51:10,110
Look at these guys. I mean,

1244
00:51:10,284 --> 00:51:11,459
Lights couldn't make a basket

1245
00:51:11,633 --> 00:51:13,070
if he had a braille trail to it.

1246
00:51:13,244 --> 00:51:14,636
Raindrop!

1247
00:51:14,810 --> 00:51:16,450
Big Fella and Uncle
Drew, they're talkin'.

1248
00:51:16,595 --> 00:51:18,640
- You're not open to me.
- Pass the ball, Kobe.

1249
00:51:18,814 --> 00:51:19,946
Come on, guys!

1250
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,469
I got it.

1251
00:51:21,643 --> 00:51:23,950
Lights out, baby. Wait a minute.

1252
00:51:24,124 --> 00:51:25,908
You see? That's good basketball.

1253
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:27,443
Barbeque chicken,
barbeque chicken.

1254
00:51:27,562 --> 00:51:29,042
Lobster in the house.

1255
00:51:29,216 --> 00:51:30,739
Big Fella! There you go!
There you go!

1256
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,525
Better step out.

1257
00:51:34,656 --> 00:51:36,528
- Come on.
- Time out!

1258
00:51:36,702 --> 00:51:37,809
See the way they move
without the ball?

1259
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:39,008
They're all connected as one.

1260
00:51:39,183 --> 00:51:40,532
Reminds me of us
back in the day.

1261
00:51:40,706 --> 00:51:42,229
Of us?

1262
00:51:42,403 --> 00:51:44,283
If they score one more
point, fellas, that's it.

1263
00:51:44,405 --> 00:51:46,285
Come on, Drew, you told
me these dudes can play.

1264
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:47,680
This guy right here
can't even see.

1265
00:51:47,843 --> 00:51:49,203
Look, I'm standing
here doing this.

1266
00:51:49,367 --> 00:51:50,735
He don't even know I'm doing that.
Okay?

1267
00:51:50,759 --> 00:51:52,631
And this dude,
he's a karate man.

1268
00:51:52,805 --> 00:51:54,502
He's meditating right now.

1269
00:51:54,676 --> 00:51:56,896
Y'all gotta get it together.
Drew, it's on you now, man.

1270
00:51:57,070 --> 00:51:59,246
Stop passing the ball.

1271
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:02,510
You are the lead singer,
the leader of this team.

1272
00:52:02,684 --> 00:52:04,684
You are Gladys Knight and
these dudes are the Pips.

1273
00:52:04,817 --> 00:52:07,298
It's just a scrimmage, youngblood.
That's all it is.

1274
00:52:07,472 --> 00:52:09,604
It's not just a scrimmage! Okay?

1275
00:52:11,345 --> 00:52:12,955
Look, I bet $100 on the game.

1276
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,490
- What?
- What am I supposed to do?

1277
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:16,220
Man, we don't have
no more gas left.

1278
00:52:16,394 --> 00:52:18,328
We're just runnin' on fumes.
What you want me to do?

1279
00:52:18,352 --> 00:52:20,093
Look, guys, they need to score

1280
00:52:20,267 --> 00:52:21,877
one more time. Just stop 'em.

1281
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:23,531
You're really tall.

1282
00:52:23,705 --> 00:52:25,425
Just put your arms up,
they're little girls.

1283
00:52:32,453 --> 00:52:33,585
Come on, man!

1284
00:52:35,674 --> 00:52:40,853
Good job, guys. Stayin' alive, breathing.
Good effort.

1285
00:52:41,027 --> 00:52:42,811
Great teamwork, girls.
Great teamwork.

1286
00:52:42,985 --> 00:52:44,552
Good game, good game.

1287
00:52:44,726 --> 00:52:45,727
Good game, ladies.

1288
00:52:47,468 --> 00:52:49,253
Hey, Coach.

1289
00:52:49,427 --> 00:52:50,950
Pleasure doing
business with you.

1290
00:52:54,954 --> 00:52:57,086
Yeah. Me and the
fellas teamed up

1291
00:52:57,261 --> 00:52:58,479
to take care of that for you.

1292
00:52:59,567 --> 00:53:00,873
I just don't understand

1293
00:53:01,047 --> 00:53:02,567
why you ain't ask us
for the gas money?

1294
00:53:04,093 --> 00:53:07,271
It's not a big deal.
Just had to tell us.

1295
00:53:07,445 --> 00:53:08,924
And, remember,

1296
00:53:09,098 --> 00:53:11,231
Gladys Knight ain't
nothing without the Pips.

1297
00:53:18,499 --> 00:53:21,198
Listen, Drew, I really
appreciate you guys

1298
00:53:21,372 --> 00:53:23,635
having my back
back there, right?

1299
00:53:23,809 --> 00:53:25,265
But that doesn't take
away from the fact

1300
00:53:25,289 --> 00:53:26,409
that we got our butts kicked

1301
00:53:26,464 --> 00:53:27,856
by some teenage girls.

1302
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:29,641
Matter of fact, maybe
we should look

1303
00:53:29,815 --> 00:53:31,935
- to get some more players.
- Forget that, youngblood.

1304
00:53:33,079 --> 00:53:34,863
My roster, my team.

1305
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:43,568
Mind if we talk for a minute?

1306
00:53:46,832 --> 00:53:48,766
I was thinking about the way
we used to run pick and roll.

1307
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,227
Might make sense if...

1308
00:53:55,493 --> 00:53:56,494
Fine.

1309
00:53:58,844 --> 00:54:00,237
Everything good
back there, Preach?

1310
00:54:00,411 --> 00:54:02,848
Just thinking about
my Betty Lou is all.

1311
00:54:04,371 --> 00:54:06,460
You'll be back in her
arms before you know it.

1312
00:54:40,189 --> 00:54:42,322
Yes! It may have took
us a while to get here,

1313
00:54:42,496 --> 00:54:45,499
but we are finally
here at the Rucker.

1314
00:54:45,673 --> 00:54:47,193
Some of the greatest
basketball players

1315
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,981
you've ever seen have
played in this...

1316
00:54:49,155 --> 00:54:51,113
You mind giving us a
minute, youngblood?

1317
00:54:52,898 --> 00:54:55,204
Okay. Sure.

1318
00:54:58,077 --> 00:54:59,296
We're here, fellas.

1319
00:55:01,254 --> 00:55:02,386
Oh, man.

1320
00:55:05,519 --> 00:55:07,565
I played on damn near
every outdoor court

1321
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:09,262
in the country over the years,

1322
00:55:09,436 --> 00:55:11,133
but battling between the lines,

1323
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,962
with you fellas here,
always felt like home.

1324
00:55:14,136 --> 00:55:16,356
Feel you, Drew. I feel you.

1325
00:55:17,792 --> 00:55:19,707
I got each of you a
little something.

1326
00:55:24,016 --> 00:55:26,975
Now, I know you never liked
the way they looked,

1327
00:55:27,149 --> 00:55:30,022
but Doc put a lens in
there for a reason.

1328
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,549
Take your time, now.

1329
00:55:35,723 --> 00:55:37,986
Now, go help him put it on.
Put it on.

1330
00:55:43,818 --> 00:55:45,820
Why didn't y'all say anything?

1331
00:55:48,562 --> 00:55:53,132
Man, y'all look so... So old.

1332
00:55:53,306 --> 00:55:54,873
I think he can see.

1333
00:55:55,047 --> 00:55:59,617
And, Preach. That face!

1334
00:55:59,791 --> 00:56:02,881
I can see! Lights out, baby!

1335
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:04,752
Whoo-hoo!

1336
00:56:04,926 --> 00:56:08,452
Oh, yeah! Yeah, Drew.

1337
00:56:08,626 --> 00:56:10,932
Welcome home, Lights.
Welcome home.

1338
00:56:12,107 --> 00:56:14,153
I know you remember this one.

1339
00:56:14,327 --> 00:56:16,547
Gave it to me when we was nine.

1340
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:19,201
You told me...

1341
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,701
Told you it would
give you a strength

1342
00:56:20,725 --> 00:56:22,248
you didn't even
know that you had.

1343
00:56:22,422 --> 00:56:26,121
And it did. Now it's your turn.

1344
00:56:38,786 --> 00:56:41,615
Oh, come finish this, Preach.
Come finish it.

1345
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:43,008
All right, Preacher!

1346
00:56:43,182 --> 00:56:44,966
Aw, yeah, baby.

1347
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,839
Boots, you ain't think I
forgot about you, did you?

1348
00:56:48,970 --> 00:56:50,972
Left 'em back in the van in '68.

1349
00:56:51,146 --> 00:56:53,186
Figured they might still got
a little spring to 'em.

1350
00:56:58,371 --> 00:56:59,416
Yeah.

1351
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:02,897
Just like you left 'em. Hmm?

1352
00:57:10,252 --> 00:57:11,252
I love you, too, bruh.

1353
00:57:12,951 --> 00:57:14,474
Easy now.

1354
00:57:14,648 --> 00:57:16,128
Let's see if they fit
before you start

1355
00:57:16,258 --> 00:57:18,217
going and getting all
emotional on me.

1356
00:57:33,624 --> 00:57:34,668
No, wait. Is he...

1357
00:57:36,365 --> 00:57:37,715
He can't get up. He...

1358
00:57:45,374 --> 00:57:46,898
Yeah. Yeah.

1359
00:57:47,725 --> 00:57:49,074
Oh, nice.

1360
00:57:50,858 --> 00:57:52,860
Look as good as the first
time you put 'em on.

1361
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:01,826
Yeah.

1362
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,305
Yeah, Bootsie!

1363
00:58:05,569 --> 00:58:07,396
That's it, Boots. That's it.

1364
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:11,313
Kinda like breathing. Couldn't
forget how even if you tried.

1365
00:58:18,364 --> 00:58:20,235
I saved the best for last.

1366
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:26,067
Brick City Two-on-Two
Tournament,

1367
00:58:26,241 --> 00:58:27,721
when we was 15 years old.

1368
00:58:27,895 --> 00:58:30,245
First tournament we
ever won together.

1369
00:58:44,956 --> 00:58:46,174
Yeah.

1370
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,138
This ain't no apology.

1371
00:58:53,312 --> 00:58:54,531
Don't even try it.

1372
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,020
Big Fella. Big Fella.

1373
00:59:13,288 --> 00:59:15,508
Hey, Jess. Come on, open up, it's me.
It's Dax.

1374
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:16,727
Yeah, I got a team now.

1375
00:59:16,901 --> 00:59:18,729
I really think we got a chance.

1376
00:59:18,903 --> 00:59:21,470
Did it ever occur to
you to call first?

1377
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:23,124
It did occur to
me to call first.

1378
00:59:23,298 --> 00:59:25,779
But I couldn't because you
cut my cell phone off.

1379
00:59:25,953 --> 00:59:28,608
That's because I broke up
with your pathetic ass.

1380
00:59:28,782 --> 00:59:30,262
But you know what?

1381
00:59:30,436 --> 00:59:32,830
My new boyfriend, he
took care of everything.

1382
00:59:33,004 --> 00:59:34,416
Wait, what you mean, you
got a new boyfriend?

1383
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,440
We just broke up...

1384
00:59:36,747 --> 00:59:38,487
Hey, what's up?

1385
00:59:38,662 --> 00:59:40,054
What's that facial expression?

1386
00:59:40,228 --> 00:59:42,230
You look like someone
just took your girl.

1387
00:59:42,404 --> 00:59:43,754
Oh, that's right.

1388
00:59:43,928 --> 00:59:45,383
Oh, I think that's
what happened, though.

1389
00:59:45,407 --> 00:59:46,670
Yeah.

1390
00:59:46,844 --> 00:59:48,280
Sorry we couldn't
hear you knocking

1391
00:59:48,454 --> 00:59:50,108
- 'cause we was in the shower.
- Mmm-hmm.

1392
00:59:50,282 --> 00:59:51,564
We weren't gettin'
clean, were we?

1393
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,154
No, we weren't.

1394
00:59:53,328 --> 00:59:55,374
- No, we were getting dirty.
- Dirty. You so dirty.

1395
00:59:55,548 --> 00:59:57,332
Y'all know I'm
standing here, right?

1396
00:59:57,506 --> 00:59:58,875
Can I just get my uniforms
and get out of here?

1397
00:59:58,899 --> 00:59:59,900
- Uniforms?
- Uniforms.

1398
01:00:00,074 --> 01:00:01,162
- How come?
- I got a team.

1399
01:00:01,336 --> 01:00:02,686
- You got a team?
- Yes.

1400
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:05,645
- Aw, that's cute, bruh.
- Mmm-hmm.

1401
01:00:05,819 --> 01:00:07,168
- That's real cute.
- Here ya go.

1402
01:00:07,342 --> 01:00:09,823
Good luck. Hey, will
you cook me breakfast?

1403
01:00:09,997 --> 01:00:11,317
Mmm, I'll make you
an omelet, boo.

1404
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:13,218
Oh, I'mma scramble your eggs.

1405
01:00:13,392 --> 01:00:15,568
Welcome, ladies and
gentlemen, boys and girls,

1406
01:00:15,742 --> 01:00:17,875
to the Rucker 50th
Tournament of Champions.

1407
01:00:18,049 --> 01:00:20,355
I am yours truly, Duke Tango.

1408
01:00:20,529 --> 01:00:22,619
Today we bring you
the best of the best

1409
01:00:22,793 --> 01:00:26,057
of the Rucker crowd
and $100,000.

1410
01:00:26,231 --> 01:00:28,233
That's right, $100,000,

1411
01:00:28,407 --> 01:00:32,063
and it's all here
in Harlem, US of A!

1412
01:00:32,237 --> 01:00:33,760
This is where it happens.

1413
01:00:33,934 --> 01:00:35,762
This will make you,
this will break you.

1414
01:00:35,936 --> 01:00:38,069
Here we go! Game one.

1415
01:00:38,243 --> 01:00:40,549
Hilltop Mavericks versus
Homecourt Advantage.

1416
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:43,683
Let's do this! Let's do this!
Oh, yeah!

1417
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:24,289
It's one of those days

1418
01:01:24,463 --> 01:01:25,769
when the crowd is a little thin.

1419
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:33,298
Now, is it me or is
it empty in here?

1420
01:01:33,472 --> 01:01:35,126
Nah, Preach, it ain't you.

1421
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:38,172
We used to ball out in front
of twice as many people.

1422
01:01:38,346 --> 01:01:39,946
Youngblood, I don't
know about this name.

1423
01:01:40,044 --> 01:01:41,698
Bruh, I'm straight
from Chocolate City.

1424
01:01:41,872 --> 01:01:43,458
Yeah, I think, guys, it's more
about where we are now...

1425
01:01:43,482 --> 01:01:45,614
Stop! Look, it's not
about the name.

1426
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:48,095
We don't have a
fifth player, guys.

1427
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:50,030
If we don't get nobody
else, we gotta forfeit.

1428
01:01:50,054 --> 01:01:51,490
We need Big Fella.
Where is he at?

1429
01:01:51,664 --> 01:01:53,013
He'll be here.

1430
01:01:53,187 --> 01:01:55,276
Yeah, but what if he's not?

1431
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:57,278
I'm pretty sure those
basketball shoes.

1432
01:01:57,452 --> 01:01:59,411
Although, your
calf-to-shoe ratio

1433
01:01:59,585 --> 01:02:00,934
is not all that great.

1434
01:02:01,108 --> 01:02:02,303
Yeah, and his body's really bad.

1435
01:02:02,327 --> 01:02:03,807
It's not built for jumping.

1436
01:02:03,981 --> 01:02:04,677
Okay. Okay. Let me tell
y'all something...

1437
01:02:04,851 --> 01:02:06,200
I don't play basketball.

1438
01:02:06,374 --> 01:02:08,637
And, yes, my calves
don't match my body.

1439
01:02:08,812 --> 01:02:10,452
I done had these calves
since I was seven.

1440
01:02:10,509 --> 01:02:12,226
Went to a doctor, saw
somebody, and he was, like,

1441
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,444
"Hey, man, we don't know
what we can do about it."

1442
01:02:13,468 --> 01:02:15,601
Yes! He is here.

1443
01:02:15,775 --> 01:02:19,387
The Black Messiah. Grandfather.
Okay.

1444
01:02:19,561 --> 01:02:20,921
- Don't. He is here...
- He's here.

1445
01:02:21,041 --> 01:02:22,062
Everybody get on the court.

1446
01:02:22,086 --> 01:02:24,001
Let's go.

1447
01:02:28,309 --> 01:02:30,050
What are you doing? Move!

1448
01:02:30,224 --> 01:02:31,332
Something you wanna say to me?

1449
01:02:31,356 --> 01:02:33,184
We're in the middle of a game!

1450
01:02:33,358 --> 01:02:34,552
Can we get some help out here?

1451
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:36,404
I don't know what's going on

1452
01:02:36,578 --> 01:02:37,405
at the half court position,
but it ain't helping 'em.

1453
01:02:37,579 --> 01:02:38,929
Are they fighting?

1454
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,254
I'm not running down
until you say it.

1455
01:02:40,278 --> 01:02:41,540
- Say what?
- You know what.

1456
01:02:41,714 --> 01:02:42,889
I'm not talking about her.

1457
01:02:43,063 --> 01:02:43,803
Hey, hey, hey, timeout.

1458
01:02:43,977 --> 01:02:46,153
Yo, yo, yo! Hey, hey.

1459
01:02:46,327 --> 01:02:48,044
Come here, bring it in.
What are you two doing?

1460
01:02:48,068 --> 01:02:49,591
I ain't run out on my old lady

1461
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:50,549
just so we can come out
here and play like this.

1462
01:02:50,723 --> 01:02:52,072
I'm out.

1463
01:02:52,246 --> 01:02:53,354
Hey, nah, you're not
going nowhere, Drew.

1464
01:02:53,378 --> 01:02:54,727
You will stay right here.

1465
01:02:54,901 --> 01:02:56,183
And I don't know what
you two are doing.

1466
01:02:56,207 --> 01:02:57,487
You said you wanna
teach the kids

1467
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:59,340
how to play the
game the right way.

1468
01:02:59,514 --> 01:03:01,536
But this is not the right way,
arguin' with your teammate.

1469
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,519
Let's play some basketball!
We are a team.

1470
01:03:04,693 --> 01:03:06,870
Bring it in, guys. Come on.

1471
01:03:07,044 --> 01:03:09,524
Whatever y'all got going on,
work it out after the game.

1472
01:03:09,698 --> 01:03:12,571
Bring it in. Harlem
Money on three.

1473
01:03:12,745 --> 01:03:13,485
- One...
- Let's go get this money, man.

1474
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:14,659
Come on.

1475
01:03:15,617 --> 01:03:17,141
Well, just play.

1476
01:03:17,315 --> 01:03:18,315
Back to live action,

1477
01:03:18,446 --> 01:03:19,447
here we go!

1478
01:03:19,621 --> 01:03:21,362
This is Boots with the ball.

1479
01:03:21,536 --> 01:03:25,497
Over to my man, Uncle. Uncle Drew, yes!
Uncle Drew!

1480
01:03:25,671 --> 01:03:27,934
This is The Mosquito
with the handle.

1481
01:03:28,108 --> 01:03:30,241
Oh, no, no, no! Steal
away for Uncle!

1482
01:03:32,417 --> 01:03:33,505
Look at the handle.

1483
01:03:37,944 --> 01:03:39,990
75 years old and still
can't admit it.

1484
01:03:47,258 --> 01:03:48,694
Selfish son of a bitch.

1485
01:03:48,868 --> 01:03:51,697
Uncle Drew doing it once again.

1486
01:03:53,612 --> 01:03:56,833
It's the third period, baby.
The Uncle Drew Show continues.

1487
01:04:06,103 --> 01:04:08,105
Harlem Money is running
away with this one.

1488
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:10,847
Another basket and they will
be going to the next round.

1489
01:04:11,021 --> 01:04:12,694
How come you just can't
admit you messed up?

1490
01:04:12,718 --> 01:04:13,850
We hardly even knew her.

1491
01:04:14,024 --> 01:04:15,088
Matter of fact, I bet you can't

1492
01:04:15,112 --> 01:04:16,287
even remember her dang name.

1493
01:04:16,461 --> 01:04:17,854
You don't remember
her dang name?

1494
01:04:20,465 --> 01:04:21,640
I married her, punk.

1495
01:04:26,384 --> 01:04:28,473
Come on, baby. Come on.

1496
01:04:28,647 --> 01:04:29,953
You really wanna
make this right?

1497
01:04:30,127 --> 01:04:31,432
Stop running from the truth.

1498
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:50,099
Can't believe you ended up

1499
01:04:50,147 --> 01:04:52,149
marrying her anyway.

1500
01:04:52,323 --> 01:04:53,430
Can't believe you slept with her

1501
01:04:53,454 --> 01:04:54,760
the night before the finals.

1502
01:04:57,981 --> 01:04:59,199
I loved her.

1503
01:05:00,418 --> 01:05:01,858
I don't know if you
knew this, but...

1504
01:05:01,941 --> 01:05:03,464
Yeah, I knew.

1505
01:05:04,509 --> 01:05:06,337
I always knew.

1506
01:05:06,511 --> 01:05:09,644
Spent five decades
pretending like I didn't.

1507
01:05:09,818 --> 01:05:10,970
But I saw the way
you looked at her

1508
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:12,517
when she walked in the park.

1509
01:05:12,691 --> 01:05:14,301
So, why'd you do it, then?

1510
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:18,349
I loved her, too.

1511
01:05:22,048 --> 01:05:25,051
Look, Big Fella, I'm sorry.

1512
01:05:28,489 --> 01:05:30,709
I've been sorry my
whole damn life.

1513
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,321
You mean that?

1514
01:05:34,495 --> 01:05:36,106
I mean that with
everything I got.

1515
01:05:39,718 --> 01:05:41,938
If I can go back and
change it, I would.

1516
01:05:43,243 --> 01:05:44,288
Believe me.

1517
01:05:53,166 --> 01:05:54,863
I need you to feed me.

1518
01:05:55,429 --> 01:05:56,691
Excuse me?

1519
01:05:56,865 --> 01:05:58,171
You may not understand this,

1520
01:05:58,345 --> 01:06:00,521
but, uh, I can really
shoot the ball.

1521
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:02,959
Let the Big Fella eat, huh?

1522
01:06:03,133 --> 01:06:05,004
Like The Last Supper, baby.

1523
01:06:05,787 --> 01:06:07,615
Oh, too slow, too slow.

1524
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:09,878
Hey, that ain't no figment
of my imagination.

1525
01:06:10,053 --> 01:06:11,663
Somebody 'bout to
eat their words.

1526
01:06:11,837 --> 01:06:14,927
That's Drew there.
Hey, Drew, hey!

1527
01:06:15,101 --> 01:06:17,036
Look at that face! Go ahead,
scratch and smell him.

1528
01:06:17,060 --> 01:06:17,886
Scratch and smell him.

1529
01:06:18,061 --> 01:06:19,714
- You real.
- Yeah.

1530
01:06:19,888 --> 01:06:22,239
He real. He real man.
This ain't no hologram.

1531
01:06:22,413 --> 01:06:23,651
Been a minute, Angelo.
What's goin' on?

1532
01:06:23,675 --> 01:06:25,155
Oh, been a minute.

1533
01:06:25,329 --> 01:06:27,002
Good to see you, Drew.
Always good to see you.

1534
01:06:27,026 --> 01:06:30,116
What you gonna do with all
that money when you win?

1535
01:06:30,290 --> 01:06:32,989
- Come again?
- The purse. The purse, Drew.

1536
01:06:33,163 --> 01:06:35,730
The hundred stacks of
high society at stake.

1537
01:06:35,904 --> 01:06:37,167
You know, the duckets.

1538
01:06:37,341 --> 01:06:38,864
Wasn't ever no purse
back in the day.

1539
01:06:39,038 --> 01:06:40,953
No, it wasn't ever
nothin' like that.

1540
01:06:41,127 --> 01:06:44,087
But $100,000 of cash, baby.

1541
01:06:44,261 --> 01:06:47,655
I'd sign up, you know
what I'm saying?

1542
01:06:52,791 --> 01:06:54,071
You think I'm
stupid, youngblood?

1543
01:06:54,140 --> 01:06:55,881
Hundred grand is a
whole lot of money.

1544
01:06:57,622 --> 01:06:58,816
Look, man, I was gonna
talk to you about...

1545
01:06:58,840 --> 01:07:01,365
Yeah, when? When?

1546
01:07:01,539 --> 01:07:05,108
You just don't get it, do you, youngblood?
This game...

1547
01:07:05,282 --> 01:07:09,982
The love I got for it,
it's all sacred to me.

1548
01:07:10,156 --> 01:07:11,592
You told me that
you love the game.

1549
01:07:11,766 --> 01:07:13,638
You don't love the game.

1550
01:07:13,812 --> 01:07:16,597
You use it just like you use
everything else in your life.

1551
01:07:16,771 --> 01:07:18,425
You ain't nothing but a hustler.

1552
01:07:22,299 --> 01:07:24,083
Hey, man, who you
talking to, man?

1553
01:07:24,257 --> 01:07:26,259
Hey! Talkin' to you, man.

1554
01:07:26,433 --> 01:07:27,826
Watch your tone, youngblood.

1555
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,543
You don't think I got
love for this game?

1556
01:07:29,567 --> 01:07:31,167
Don't nobody love this
game more than me.

1557
01:07:31,308 --> 01:07:33,832
Talkin' about Jordan, 63 against Boston.
I saw that.

1558
01:07:34,006 --> 01:07:35,616
Laettner's turnaround
against Kentucky.

1559
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:37,357
Bird steals the ball to win

1560
01:07:37,531 --> 01:07:39,794
the Eastern Conference
Finals to beat the Pistons.

1561
01:07:39,968 --> 01:07:41,970
I saw all of that
and I loved it.

1562
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:44,712
But guess what, the game
never loved me back.

1563
01:07:46,932 --> 01:07:48,064
So, then what happened then?

1564
01:07:52,851 --> 01:07:54,331
I missed a shot.

1565
01:07:56,333 --> 01:07:57,986
I shot it, it got blocked.

1566
01:07:59,423 --> 01:08:02,687
I was humiliated. Everybody
walked out on me.

1567
01:08:07,779 --> 01:08:10,260
Now, that's the first real
thing you've done said.

1568
01:08:11,043 --> 01:08:12,653
That's the real Dax.

1569
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:18,268
Now, come on, let's
go play this game.

1570
01:08:18,442 --> 01:08:21,140
It's about the love,
youngblood, nothin' else.

1571
01:08:36,851 --> 01:08:38,679
- Yes!
- Get it, Grandpa!

1572
01:08:38,853 --> 01:08:40,899
This Big Fella. This
is the Big Fella.

1573
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:43,902
Ooh!

1574
01:08:44,076 --> 01:08:45,860
Ah, shit, I'm loose.

1575
01:08:46,034 --> 01:08:48,167
Uncle looking at it. What
he gonna do with it?

1576
01:08:52,258 --> 01:08:54,347
- The Preacher!
- Oh, in the name of Jesus!

1577
01:08:54,521 --> 01:08:56,088
Finally gettin' my
legs back, y'all.

1578
01:08:57,742 --> 01:09:00,223
This is Uncle Drew to Lights.

1579
01:09:02,616 --> 01:09:03,748
- Money!
- All right, Lights!

1580
01:09:03,922 --> 01:09:05,358
The reason they call me Lights.

1581
01:09:08,840 --> 01:09:10,102
Yeah!

1582
01:09:11,451 --> 01:09:12,851
Don't bring your
little ass in here.

1583
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:52,753
- And that's it?
- That's right.

1584
01:09:52,927 --> 01:09:56,888
You swipe right if you like
'em, left if you don't.

1585
01:09:57,062 --> 01:09:58,977
You couldn't even see the
day before yesterday.

1586
01:09:59,151 --> 01:10:00,413
Mmm-hmm. Exactly.

1587
01:10:00,587 --> 01:10:02,415
That's why I'm always
swipin' right.

1588
01:10:02,589 --> 01:10:04,200
It's more of a numbers game.

1589
01:10:08,029 --> 01:10:10,728
Looks a little different
these days, don't it?

1590
01:10:10,902 --> 01:10:13,426
She gonna get him pregnant if
she keep dancing like that.

1591
01:10:14,949 --> 01:10:16,473
If I wasn't so sore,

1592
01:10:16,647 --> 01:10:18,779
we'd get out there and
show 'em our old routine.

1593
01:10:21,086 --> 01:10:23,306
Excuse me, son, do we amuse you?

1594
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:26,961
Yo, you're in the club, and
you're pushin' 80, bro.

1595
01:10:27,135 --> 01:10:29,094
And what's up with your
boy, Frederick Douglass?

1596
01:10:29,268 --> 01:10:30,791
Hey!

1597
01:10:30,965 --> 01:10:33,098
Heard he was doing great things.

1598
01:10:37,015 --> 01:10:38,016
Hold my beer.

1599
01:10:38,190 --> 01:10:39,190
Grandpa!

1600
01:10:39,278 --> 01:10:42,194
Don't hurt nobody, pop.

1601
01:10:42,368 --> 01:10:45,937
Ah, yeah! Gonna get real
grody up in this joint now!

1602
01:11:24,976 --> 01:11:26,194
Oh, my God!

1603
01:11:39,686 --> 01:11:42,298
Oh! Oh! Oh!

1604
01:12:28,822 --> 01:12:30,583
You know somethin', man? I did
not think your grandfather

1605
01:12:30,607 --> 01:12:32,391
would ever get up out
that wheelchair.

1606
01:12:32,565 --> 01:12:33,740
Me neither. I heard stories,

1607
01:12:33,914 --> 01:12:35,414
but I never knew he
could play like that.

1608
01:12:35,438 --> 01:12:36,502
So how much your
parents paying you

1609
01:12:36,526 --> 01:12:37,831
to watch your grandfather?

1610
01:12:38,005 --> 01:12:39,616
Why does anybody have
to be paying me?

1611
01:12:39,790 --> 01:12:41,724
Why can't I just enjoy
spending time with my family?

1612
01:12:41,748 --> 01:12:43,247
Well, I wouldn't know
anything about that.

1613
01:12:43,271 --> 01:12:44,795
'Cause I never had one. So...

1614
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:46,797
What do you mean you
never really had one?

1615
01:12:46,971 --> 01:12:48,320
What do you call those guys?

1616
01:12:57,634 --> 01:12:59,200
I honestly had a lot
of fun tonight.

1617
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:00,550
Me too.

1618
01:13:05,032 --> 01:13:06,556
Well, I guess it's time to go.

1619
01:13:06,730 --> 01:13:09,689
Yeah, we should go ahead
and get up out of...

1620
01:13:13,606 --> 01:13:15,086
He ain't gonna do it.

1621
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:17,480
Hey.

1622
01:13:17,654 --> 01:13:19,177
- Hey.
- It's you!

1623
01:13:19,351 --> 01:13:21,092
No! Mmm-mmm.

1624
01:13:21,266 --> 01:13:22,746
- You open!
- Take a shot!

1625
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:28,665
Sorry. I'mma go. I
need some water.

1626
01:13:28,839 --> 01:13:30,928
- Sure.
- 'Cause my throat is dry.

1627
01:13:31,102 --> 01:13:33,670
Yeah, I know how that is.
I'll take care of this.

1628
01:13:33,844 --> 01:13:35,364
Take a gap? Thank
you, appreciate that.

1629
01:13:35,454 --> 01:13:36,890
Yeah, yeah. Don't
worry about it.

1630
01:13:37,064 --> 01:13:38,501
Anybody give him some training

1631
01:13:38,675 --> 01:13:40,416
on how to talk to a lady?

1632
01:13:42,330 --> 01:13:43,941
Okay, look, man, I
don't wanna hear that.

1633
01:13:44,115 --> 01:13:46,422
Anything, okay? Not one
single freakin' word.

1634
01:13:46,596 --> 01:13:48,989
Maybe she should've
taken her heels off.

1635
01:13:49,163 --> 01:13:51,078
I'll tell ya, youngblood,
last time I checked,

1636
01:13:51,252 --> 01:13:54,038
you miss 100% of the
shots you don't take.

1637
01:13:54,212 --> 01:13:55,492
Yeah, let's get
out of here, man.

1638
01:13:57,781 --> 01:13:58,999
Let's give him a piggyback.

1639
01:13:59,173 --> 01:14:00,566
Big Fella, what are you doing?

1640
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:02,394
We'll give him a
little piggyback.

1641
01:14:02,568 --> 01:14:04,568
That's right. Two down, two to go.
We almost there.

1642
01:14:10,576 --> 01:14:12,926
Yo, how's that geriatric
team of yours, bro?

1643
01:14:13,100 --> 01:14:15,407
You get 'em all individual
Life Alert bracelets?

1644
01:14:15,581 --> 01:14:17,061
Hey, man, are you
wearing my clothes?

1645
01:14:17,235 --> 01:14:19,063
- What?
- Yes, that's my shirt.

1646
01:14:19,237 --> 01:14:20,456
You got on my shirt, man.

1647
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:22,980
That's right, I got
on your shirt.

1648
01:14:23,154 --> 01:14:25,156
Or maybe you got my shirt on.

1649
01:14:25,330 --> 01:14:27,245
- What? Wait, wait.
- What? Wait, wait.

1650
01:14:27,419 --> 01:14:28,899
- That's my shirt.
- That's my shirt.

1651
01:14:29,073 --> 01:14:30,746
- You got on my clothes.
- You got on my clothes.

1652
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:32,356
- Stop it! You're crazy.
- Stop it! You're crazy.

1653
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:35,340
That's right. I'm crazy.
I'm being you.

1654
01:14:35,514 --> 01:14:37,298
The only way to
defeat one's enemy

1655
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:38,909
is to become one's enemy.

1656
01:14:40,606 --> 01:14:41,726
- You're nuts!
- You're nuts!

1657
01:14:43,696 --> 01:14:45,524
- You're psycho!
- You're psycho!

1658
01:14:45,698 --> 01:14:49,572
I'll see you in the finals, Dax.
Psycho.

1659
01:15:08,852 --> 01:15:09,983
All day.

1660
01:15:15,336 --> 01:15:16,860
Yes! There you go, Big Fella!

1661
01:15:17,034 --> 01:15:18,634
That's what I'm talking
about, Big Fella!

1662
01:15:19,602 --> 01:15:21,908
Off shot! Handled it.

1663
01:15:22,082 --> 01:15:23,562
- Good rebound!
- All right.

1664
01:15:25,346 --> 01:15:28,219
Oh, shot, shot, shot.
Get that out of here!

1665
01:15:28,393 --> 01:15:30,264
- What do I do, what do I do?
- Just back up.

1666
01:15:31,918 --> 01:15:33,311
Oh, yeah. I remember this play.

1667
01:15:34,617 --> 01:15:36,444
Too late. Got 'em.

1668
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:38,534
Yes! That's what I'm
talkin' about, Lights.

1669
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:40,100
You are the man!

1670
01:15:41,711 --> 01:15:44,365
This is Boots. Boots
goin' down death valley!

1671
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:46,629
Uh-huh! Baby!

1672
01:15:46,803 --> 01:15:49,066
Harlem Money is going
to the finals,

1673
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:51,677
with only seconds
left in the ballgame!

1674
01:15:53,244 --> 01:15:55,202
- Still hungry, huh?
- Just a little dessert.

1675
01:15:55,376 --> 01:15:57,204
Hey, take the three,
Big Fella, why not?

1676
01:15:57,378 --> 01:15:59,555
This is to send 'em.
They're already there.

1677
01:15:59,729 --> 01:16:01,208
That's all right, Big Fella.

1678
01:16:05,082 --> 01:16:06,562
Big Fella.

1679
01:16:06,736 --> 01:16:08,259
Big Fella. Big Fella. Big Fella.

1680
01:16:08,433 --> 01:16:09,956
- Somebody get a doctor.
- Big Fella.

1681
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:11,740
Come on!

1682
01:16:13,264 --> 01:16:14,676
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
Let me in here.

1683
01:16:14,700 --> 01:16:16,093
The Big Fella is down.

1684
01:16:16,267 --> 01:16:17,747
Stay here, Big Fella.
Stay in it.

1685
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:19,226
- Beginning CPR.
- Oh, Lord,

1686
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:20,920
give him some room,
give him some room.

1687
01:16:21,402 --> 01:16:22,969
You're okay, boss.

1688
01:16:23,143 --> 01:16:26,233
Come on, Big Fella.
Come on, Big Fella.

1689
01:16:32,413 --> 01:16:33,632
Doctor already said

1690
01:16:33,806 --> 01:16:35,126
he's been through
the worst of it.

1691
01:16:36,330 --> 01:16:38,811
So, what... What do we do now?

1692
01:16:42,162 --> 01:16:44,121
You don't stop playing
'cause you get old.

1693
01:16:45,557 --> 01:16:47,341
You get old 'cause
you stop playing.

1694
01:16:50,301 --> 01:16:51,868
Preacher!

1695
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:57,264
Hi. And I'm so sorry

1696
01:16:57,438 --> 01:16:59,615
about the Big Fella.
Is he gonna be okay?

1697
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:03,836
But I've been missing
you so much.

1698
01:17:04,010 --> 01:17:05,316
Come here, come here.

1699
01:17:05,490 --> 01:17:06,796
I missed you too, baby.

1700
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:09,189
Now, look.

1701
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:11,483
If you don't want me to go
ball, I don't have to ball.

1702
01:17:11,583 --> 01:17:15,065
Fool, please, after all this?
You're playing.

1703
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:16,544
Matter of fact...

1704
01:17:18,721 --> 01:17:20,201
You saying what I
think you're saying?

1705
01:17:20,374 --> 01:17:22,899
I'm saying what you think
I'm saying, Preacher.

1706
01:17:23,073 --> 01:17:23,900
So we gonna ball?

1707

So we gonna ball.

1708
01:17:28,034 --> 01:17:29,394
That's what I'm
talkin' about, boo.

1709
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:36,347
Welcome! This is what we've
all been waiting for.

1710
01:17:36,521 --> 01:17:38,349
The new be versus the old.

1711
01:17:38,523 --> 01:17:41,569
The old be versus the new.
The good be versus the bad.

1712
01:17:41,744 --> 01:17:44,834
Are they gonna be a no-show
like they did in 1968?

1713
01:17:45,008 --> 01:17:46,792
But, no, they're not.

1714
01:17:46,966 --> 01:17:49,577
Here they come! They're here!
Here they come, baby!

01:17:49,752 --> 01:17:51,754
Here they come! Aw, yeah!

We got a game on our hands!

1717
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:15,342
Okay, Grandpa, you
gotta take your pills

1718
01:18:15,516 --> 01:18:16,561
before you start, okay?

1719
01:18:16,735 --> 01:18:18,084
Preacher, we gotta
take our pills.

1720
01:18:18,258 --> 01:18:20,783
Not the blue ones. Save
those for tonight.

1721
01:18:20,957 --> 01:18:22,567
It's all right.
What we gonna do?

1722
01:18:22,741 --> 01:18:24,240
- We gonna get this win.
- We gonna get this win, right?

1723
01:18:24,264 --> 01:18:25,704
Look, this one's for
Big Fella, okay?

01:18:25,788 --> 01:18:27,746
So, Big Fella on three.
One, two, three.

01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:29,269
Big Fella!

1726
01:18:29,443 --> 01:18:31,141
Here we go, C-Dawg!
Let's do this, baby.

You got this, Drew.
You the man, bruh.

1728
01:18:33,447 --> 01:18:34,990
You put this team
together, remember that.

1729
01:18:35,014 --> 01:18:36,624
Your roster, my team.

1730
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:39,236
That's right, your team.
Last week, I took your team.

1731
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:41,455
Yesterday, I took your girl.

1732
01:18:41,629 --> 01:18:43,501
Today, I'm gonna
take your heart.

1733
01:18:43,675 --> 01:18:44,937
Man, you've...

1734
01:18:45,111 --> 01:18:46,286
Okay.

01:18:46,460 --> 01:18:48,549
- Stop it!
- Stop what?

1736
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:51,044
- Folding your arms like me.
- Folding your arms like that.

1737
01:18:53,293 --> 01:18:55,208
Let's get this win, baby.

1738
01:18:55,382 --> 01:18:56,993
Good luck, youngblood.

1739
01:18:57,167 --> 01:18:58,884
Oh, luck ain't got nothing
to do with it, Old Dusty.

1740
01:18:58,908 --> 01:18:59,952
"Old Dusty"?

1741
01:19:02,172 --> 01:19:04,043
Pastor Wrinkles,
what's the word, man?

1742
01:19:04,217 --> 01:19:06,872
Young fella got jokes.

1743
01:19:07,046 --> 01:19:08,446
- Shoe ain't tied.
- What shoe? Huh?

1744
01:19:08,569 --> 01:19:10,441
- Lights!
- Championship time!

1745
01:19:10,615 --> 01:19:12,071
Oh, that's the oldest
trick in the book!

1746
01:19:12,095 --> 01:19:13,575
You gonna let him...
Oh, come on, now!

01:19:13,661 --> 01:19:15,968
Over to Uncle. Jumper.

1748
01:19:16,142 --> 01:19:16,969
In and out.

1749
01:19:17,143 --> 01:19:19,580
That's okay, guys!

1750
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:22,061
The bounce pass to Casper.
Casper, oh, my God!

1751
01:19:22,235 --> 01:19:24,194
Oh, yeah, I need you to see me.

1752
01:19:24,368 --> 01:19:26,259
Wipe your goggles, old fella.
I need you to see me.

1753
01:19:26,283 --> 01:19:28,174
- You gotta see me all night.
- Man, move. Fool, please.

1754
01:19:28,198 --> 01:19:29,852
- That's right, Casper!
- Come on, Drew!

1755
01:19:30,026 --> 01:19:31,418
This is Uncle.

01:19:31,592 --> 01:19:33,159
Cross the mid-court line.
Betty...

1757
01:19:34,204 --> 01:19:36,336
Lights out! No good!

1758
01:19:36,510 --> 01:19:38,077
Oh, man!

1759
01:19:38,251 --> 01:19:39,771
That's right, old
people are overrated!

1760
01:19:43,213 --> 01:19:44,954
Over to Casper the
Friendly Ghost.

1761
01:19:45,128 --> 01:19:46,235
Nothin' but the
bottom of the net.

1762
01:19:46,259 --> 01:19:47,826
Wake up! Come on!

1763
01:19:52,265 --> 01:19:53,266
Up! Up! Up!

1764
01:19:56,139 --> 01:19:57,793
- You gotta love it!
- Yes!

1765
01:19:57,967 --> 01:19:59,167
Mario, comin' back down court,

01:20:07,890 --> 01:20:09,761
Betty Lou jumper no good.

1771

They fightin' for it, baby!
They fightin' for it!

1772
01:20:11,981 --> 01:20:14,505
Betty Lou wins it!
Get it, Betty Lou!

1773
01:20:14,679 --> 01:20:16,159
There you go, Betty Lou.
There you go!

1774
01:20:16,202 --> 01:20:17,813
You know that's really a man.

1775
01:20:18,857 --> 01:20:20,250
I got Drew.

1776
01:20:20,424 --> 01:20:22,078
Slow it down. Slow it down.

1777
01:20:22,252 --> 01:20:25,385
They tired, yo. They tired.
The fatigue's settin' in.

1778
01:20:25,559 --> 01:20:27,399
- Betty Lou. Switch it!
- Fatigue's settin' in.

1779
01:20:27,474 --> 01:20:30,129
You can hear their
knee caps grinding.

1780
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:34,699
Uncle, Betty Lou.

1781
01:20:35,178 --> 01:20:36,570
Downtown!

1782
01:20:36,744 --> 01:20:38,311
You gonna let a
girl score on you?

1783
01:20:38,485 --> 01:20:40,879
This is Casper the
Friendly Ghost.

1784
01:20:41,053 --> 01:20:42,925
Oh, my God!

1785
01:20:43,099 --> 01:20:45,275
Oh, that's right.

Damn, man!

1792
01:21:06,513 --> 01:21:07,873
Homecourt Advantage
is running away

1793
01:21:08,037 --> 01:21:09,037
with the first half.

1794
01:21:33,192 --> 01:21:34,628
My TV ain't working.

1795
01:21:36,108 --> 01:21:37,544
Do I look like an electrician?

1796
01:21:44,073 --> 01:21:45,073
I know, right?

1797
01:21:45,204 --> 01:21:47,076
Oh, yeah, that was him. Brian.

1798
01:21:50,731 --> 01:21:52,429
Y'all got a TV?

Thank you. How you doin'?
Oh, wait. Come on.

- I mean... I mean, my patient.-

1806
01:22:14,146 --> 01:22:16,168
That's my team right there. I

1807
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,758
Okay, guys, bring it in.

1808
01:22:18,629 --> 01:22:19,935
Let's turn this game around.

1811
01:22:24,417 --> 01:22:27,159
Harlem Buckets down by 16
at the start of the third.

1812
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:29,814
Here we go!

1813
01:22:29,988 --> 01:22:34,036
Casper, the Friendly
Ghost from downtown!

1814
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:36,473
Get in front of your man.

1815
01:22:36,647 --> 01:22:38,518
Boots with the ball.
Lookin' at it.

1816
01:22:38,692 --> 01:22:41,739
Boots makin' his move.
To Lights from downtown.

1817
01:22:41,913 --> 01:22:43,436
Not this time.

1818
01:22:46,526 --> 01:22:48,659
Reynolds Wrap to Casper.

1819
01:22:48,833 --> 01:22:51,183
Not today. Give me that.

1820
01:22:51,357 --> 01:22:52,663
Please, not in my house.

1821
01:22:52,837 --> 01:22:54,534
Come on, now. That's a foul!

1822
01:22:54,708 --> 01:22:56,164
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- You know that's a foul.

1823
01:22:56,188 --> 01:22:57,644
Where I'm from, it's
no blood, no foul.

1824
01:22:57,668 --> 01:22:59,308
- Where you from?
- I just came from Hell,

1825
01:22:59,365 --> 01:23:00,821
whooping the Devil's ass,
that's where I'm from.

1826
01:23:00,845 --> 01:23:01,909
- Break it up.
- That's not godly.

1827
01:23:01,933 --> 01:23:03,456
They gangbangin' for Jesus.

1828
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:05,545
Back to live action! Here we go!

1829
01:23:05,719 --> 01:23:07,721
Deflected! Goin' the other way!

1830

Good block. Come on,

1831
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:12,683
Uncle, look at him! Off the
backboard to Preacher!

1832
01:23:14,206 --> 01:23:15,526
Damn, man! Get the
ball, let's go!

1833
01:23:15,686 --> 01:23:16,948
My backboard, my house, sucker.

1834
01:23:17,122 --> 01:23:18,471
That's what I'm talkin' about!

1835
01:23:18,645 --> 01:23:19,864
Put it home, Preach!

1836
01:23:20,038 --> 01:23:21,648
That what I'm talking about!

1837
01:23:21,822 --> 01:23:23,781
This is Casper with it.
Kicks it over to Mario.

1838
01:23:23,955 --> 01:23:25,478
Jump shot. No good!

1839
01:23:25,652 --> 01:23:29,265
Yes! That's right,
y'all, we got this.

1840
01:23:29,439 --> 01:23:33,225
He kicks it over, right
side to Betty Lou!

1841
01:23:34,052 --> 01:23:35,052
Oh, my!

1842
01:23:36,489 --> 01:23:37,534
- Oh, my!
- Yeah!

1843
01:23:37,708 --> 01:23:38,926
Yes!

1844
01:23:39,101 --> 01:23:40,624
Uncle to the rescue!

1845
01:23:40,798 --> 01:23:42,452
Get on that old man!

1846
01:23:42,626 --> 01:23:44,889
Harlem Buckets are
trying to come back.

1847
01:23:45,063 --> 01:23:47,109
This is Casper with it.
Casper, looking at it.

1848
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:50,154
Come on, now!

1849
01:23:51,461 --> 01:23:52,723
I got this.

1850
01:23:52,897 --> 01:23:54,290
B-B-B-B-B-B-Boots with it.

1851
01:23:54,464 --> 01:23:55,615
Booty through the
defender's legs.

1852
01:23:55,639 --> 01:23:57,423
Look at Boots.

1853
01:23:58,685 --> 01:24:00,252
Yes! Way to finish, man.

1854
01:24:00,426 --> 01:24:01,819
I can't believe it.

1855
01:24:01,993 --> 01:24:03,342
They're trying to
make a comeback.

1856
01:24:03,516 --> 01:24:06,867
Reynolds Wrap to Casper. For 30!

1857
01:24:07,564 --> 01:24:08,913
It's shut down time.

1858
01:24:10,654 --> 01:24:12,177
Now shoot, Betty Lou. Get 'em.

1859
01:24:12,351 --> 01:24:15,702
Over to Betty Lou! Good!

1860
01:24:17,052 --> 01:24:18,444
Get your head out your ass.

1861
01:24:18,618 --> 01:24:20,316
I knew I married you
for a reason, girl.

1862
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:22,883
Game recognize game, big daddy.

1863
01:24:23,058 --> 01:24:25,495
Here we go. This is Uncle
Drew with the ball.

1864
01:24:25,669 --> 01:24:28,541
It's him and you, you and him.
What you gonna do?

1865
01:24:28,715 --> 01:24:29,715
What you gonna do?

1866
01:24:31,109 --> 01:24:33,720
Drew steps back.
Left-handed jumper...

1867
01:24:33,894 --> 01:24:35,418
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?

1868
01:24:35,592 --> 01:24:37,159
Harlem Buckets, baby.

1869
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:38,812
Kicks it out over.

1870
01:24:38,986 --> 01:24:41,032
Oh, I got this. My board, my board.
Let's go.

1871
01:24:41,206 --> 01:24:42,599
Are you kidding me?

1872
01:24:42,773 --> 01:24:46,472
Here he go. Light the light.

1873
01:24:47,038 --> 01:24:48,692
- Bang!
- Lights out, baby.

1874
01:24:48,866 --> 01:24:50,106
That makes it a two point lead.

1875
01:24:50,998 --> 01:24:53,088
Here we go! The fast break!

1876
01:24:53,262 --> 01:24:54,350
There we go, there we go!

1877
01:24:54,524 --> 01:24:56,439
- Whoa.
- I got ya now!

1878
01:24:56,613 --> 01:24:58,223
That's what I'm talking
about, Lights!

1879
01:24:58,397 --> 01:25:00,375
- Get that outta here!
- That's a foul! Come on now!

1880
01:25:00,399 --> 01:25:01,748
- Lights?
- You see that defense?

1881
01:25:01,922 --> 01:25:04,099
You all right, Lights?
Get up, man. Get up.

1882
01:25:04,273 --> 01:25:07,406
Lights. Lights,
where does it hurt?

1883
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:10,061
- Ankle.
- Okay, okay. Sit up.

1884
01:25:10,235 --> 01:25:11,628
Yo, that's bush league, Winslow.

1885
01:25:11,802 --> 01:25:12,977
You took out my player.

1886
01:25:13,151 --> 01:25:14,674
Man, what are you talking about?

1887
01:25:14,848 --> 01:25:16,937
Your boy, James Unworthy,
just knocked my boy out.

1888
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:20,767
Cheatin'-ass cheaters. Y'all
need to cheat to cheat.

1889
01:25:20,941 --> 01:25:22,702
It's gonna be all right,
it's gonna be all right.

1890
01:25:22,726 --> 01:25:24,902
I'm getting too old for this.

1891
01:25:25,076 --> 01:25:26,251
What are we gonna do, bruh?

1892
01:25:26,425 --> 01:25:28,035
Lights is out. What we gonna do?

1893
01:25:28,210 --> 01:25:29,970
- What you mean?
- What you mean, "What I mean"?

1894
01:25:29,994 --> 01:25:31,256
We have no more players left.

1895
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:32,823
It's your moment, ain't it?

1896
01:25:32,997 --> 01:25:35,217
No. I've already told
you a million times.

1897
01:25:35,391 --> 01:25:36,870
I'm not playing, okay?

1898
01:25:37,044 --> 01:25:38,872
Plus, I ain't played
in decades, bruh.

1899
01:25:39,046 --> 01:25:40,439
And they have?

1900
01:25:40,613 --> 01:25:42,006
Drew, it's different, okay?

1901
01:25:42,180 --> 01:25:43,964
They were actually
good when they played.

1902
01:25:44,878 --> 01:25:46,228
Listen to me, youngblood.

1903
01:25:46,402 --> 01:25:48,708
You think you're the only one

1904
01:25:48,882 --> 01:25:50,928
that made that mistake
that defined their life.

1905
01:25:52,016 --> 01:25:53,800
I've been on the
road my whole life.

1906
01:25:53,974 --> 01:25:55,541
I got no real friends.

1907
01:25:55,715 --> 01:25:58,370
I'm bouncin' city to city.
And you wanna know why?

1908
01:25:58,544 --> 01:26:00,894
Because I got too much
pride to say I'm sorry.

1909
01:26:01,068 --> 01:26:02,418
You know how that sounds?

1910
01:26:02,592 --> 01:26:04,004
Have too much pride
to say you're sorry

1911
01:26:04,028 --> 01:26:05,769
to the people that love you?

1912
01:26:05,943 --> 01:26:07,597
Don't you dare be like
that, youngblood.

1913
01:26:07,771 --> 01:26:09,076
You be better than that.

1914
01:26:10,339 --> 01:26:11,514
This is the moment.

1915
01:26:11,688 --> 01:26:13,124
You gonna run away from it,

1916
01:26:13,298 --> 01:26:15,257
or you gonna step
up and take it?

1917
01:26:15,431 --> 01:26:16,823
Choice is yours.

1918
01:26:18,912 --> 01:26:21,350
That's right, bruh.
Championships.

1919
01:26:21,524 --> 01:26:23,221
This is destiny now.

1920
01:26:28,313 --> 01:26:29,793
I'll play under one condition.

1921
01:26:29,967 --> 01:26:31,534
And what's that?

1922
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,233
Let me guard the white boy.

1923
01:26:36,103 --> 01:26:37,844
Let's roll!

1924
01:26:38,018 --> 01:26:40,151
It's a minute and nine
second left, folks.

1925
01:26:40,325 --> 01:26:43,763
Excuse me. Timeout, timeout.

1926
01:26:43,937 --> 01:26:46,070
- Timeout, timeout!
- Who are you?

1927
01:26:46,244 --> 01:26:47,767
I'm the assistant coach.

1928
01:26:47,941 --> 01:26:49,919
I'm here to make sure that
he's tall enough to ride

1929
01:26:49,943 --> 01:26:53,077
the ride that my man
about to put him on.

1930
01:26:53,251 --> 01:26:54,644
What are you doing, man?

1931
01:26:54,818 --> 01:26:55,925
This should be a technical
foul or something.

1932
01:26:55,949 --> 01:26:57,124
I'mma kick you off this court

1933
01:26:57,299 --> 01:26:58,648
like I kicked you out my house.

1934
01:26:58,822 --> 01:27:00,432
- That's right.
- That's mean, okay?

1935
01:27:00,606 --> 01:27:01,955
Excuse me? I don't know

1936
01:27:02,129 --> 01:27:03,609
who you are or what
this is about,

1937
01:27:03,783 --> 01:27:05,239
but could you please take
it back to the stands

1938
01:27:05,263 --> 01:27:06,903
- so we can play some ball?
- Who are you?

1939
01:27:07,047 --> 01:27:08,503
If you keep talking,
you're gonna find out.

1940
01:27:08,527 --> 01:27:09,920
Oh, you about to
find out, honey.

1941
01:27:10,094 --> 01:27:12,139
I come from a long
line of choir members.

1942
01:27:12,314 --> 01:27:13,619
So, we gonna clap back!

1943
01:27:13,793 --> 01:27:15,447
- Yeah, that's right.
- I bet you do.

1944
01:27:15,621 --> 01:27:17,541
Just clap you up out of here.
Don't play with me.

1945
01:27:17,710 --> 01:27:18,774
- I will not!
- I love you, baby.

1946
01:27:18,798 --> 01:27:20,104
I love you, too.

1947
01:27:20,278 --> 01:27:22,237
We believe in you guys.
Be aggressive.

1948
01:27:22,411 --> 01:27:23,771
- All right.
- What am I doing now?

1949
01:27:23,847 --> 01:27:25,172
Brought your girl,
playin' mind games.

1950
01:27:25,196 --> 01:27:26,304
Ain't nobody scared of you, man.

1951
01:27:26,328 --> 01:27:28,068
Oh, ain't nobody scared of me?

1952
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:30,323
- Let's do this, man.
- What's Dax doing in the game?

1953
01:27:31,289 --> 01:27:33,248
I got your back.
I got your back.

1954
01:27:33,422 --> 01:27:34,249
- Trail, Dax, trail.
- All right.

1955
01:27:34,423 --> 01:27:35,250
Yo help Uncle Drew.

1956
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:37,600
No, move. Come on.

1957
01:27:37,774 --> 01:27:39,360
It's him and you, baby.
What you gonna do?

1958
01:27:39,384 --> 01:27:42,692
Let's go, baby. Let's ball, baby.
Vanilla Sky!

1959
01:27:43,823 --> 01:27:45,651
Oh, it's a four point lead now.

1960
01:27:45,825 --> 01:27:47,265
Come on, youngblood.
That's too easy.

1961
01:27:47,436 --> 01:27:49,220
Look, it won't happen
next time, okay?

1962
01:27:49,394 --> 01:27:52,310
Uncle gently across
the mid-court line,

1963
01:27:52,484 --> 01:27:53,920
with seconds left.

1964
01:27:54,094 --> 01:27:56,009
He's gotta foul whoever
may be guardin' him.

1965
01:27:56,183 --> 01:27:57,707
Uncle to Preacher.

1966
01:27:57,881 --> 01:28:00,840
It's the Preacher, man.
Oh, baby, hallelujah!

1967
01:28:01,014 --> 01:28:02,886
Praise the Lord, Preacher,
praise the Lord.

1968
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:04,888
Here we go now.

1969
01:28:05,062 --> 01:28:07,064
Harlem Money in desperate
need of a turnover.

1970
01:28:07,238 --> 01:28:10,981
If not, Homecourt Advantage
can walk away and win it all.

1971
01:28:11,155 --> 01:28:13,113
Here we go.

1972
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:14,985
What that white boy
doing with that ball?

1973
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:16,223
Oh, he's doing his shaky-shake.

1974
01:28:16,247 --> 01:28:17,379
That's right.

1975
01:28:19,468 --> 01:28:20,860
Good steal, Dax, good steal.

1976
01:28:21,034 --> 01:28:22,034
Go on, Dax, shoot it!

1977
01:28:22,122 --> 01:28:23,167
Let it fly, Dax!

1978
01:28:23,341 --> 01:28:25,038
Shoot it, shoot it! Put it up.

1979
01:28:25,212 --> 01:28:27,092
- Come on, Dax! Shoot it!
- Take that shot, bro!

1980
01:28:27,171 --> 01:28:28,171
Shoot it!

1981
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:29,391
Timeout.

1982
01:28:29,565 --> 01:28:30,765
Timeout? You gonna make me have

1983
01:28:30,870 --> 01:28:32,350
another heart attack, boy.

1984
01:28:32,524 --> 01:28:34,570
Hey, he fouled me on that.

1985
01:28:34,744 --> 01:28:35,527
You're saying he didn't foul me?

1986
01:28:35,701 --> 01:28:37,094
That was a reach, ref.

1987
01:28:39,662 --> 01:28:41,141
Let's go.

1988
01:28:41,316 --> 01:28:43,187
Okay, relax. Listen, I got this.

1989
01:28:43,361 --> 01:28:45,711
Drew, they can't guard you, man.

1990
01:28:45,885 --> 01:28:47,123
All we need you to do is just
penetrate to the bucket,

1991
01:28:47,147 --> 01:28:48,366
do what you've been doing,

1992
01:28:48,540 --> 01:28:50,020
the defense will
collapse on you.

1993
01:28:50,194 --> 01:28:51,693
Once they do that, you
kick it out to Betty Lou.

1994
01:28:51,717 --> 01:28:53,328
Betty Lou will take the three.
That's it.

1995
01:28:53,502 --> 01:28:55,547
Game over. Game plan. That's it.

1996
01:29:00,073 --> 01:29:02,772
What? Seriously, what's
wrong with that play?

1997
01:29:02,946 --> 01:29:04,164
You'll make it.

1998
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:05,775
Excuse me?

1999
01:29:05,949 --> 01:29:07,669
Drew's right. They're
not even guarding you.

2000
01:29:07,820 --> 01:29:09,300
It's a reason for that, Lights.

2001
01:29:09,474 --> 01:29:11,346
Leave the past in
the past, move on.

2002
01:29:12,085 --> 01:29:13,783
You got this, Dax.

2003
01:29:13,957 --> 01:29:15,698
We don't need you to
be great all the time.

2004
01:29:15,872 --> 01:29:17,874
We need you to be
great this one time.

2005
01:29:19,658 --> 01:29:22,357
Can you do that?
We believe in you.

2006
01:29:23,227 --> 01:29:24,315
What if I miss?

2007
01:29:24,489 --> 01:29:25,751
What if you don't?

2008
01:29:25,925 --> 01:29:26,925
You got this.

2009
01:29:29,755 --> 01:29:31,801
Come on now.

2010
01:29:31,975 --> 01:29:33,498
Let's go. Let's bring it in.

2011
01:29:33,672 --> 01:29:34,804
We in this together.

2012
01:29:38,721 --> 01:29:41,637
You got this. Buckets on three.
One, two, three.

2013
01:29:41,811 --> 01:29:43,073
Buckets!

2014
01:29:43,247 --> 01:29:44,988
Preach, Preach, Preach.

2015
01:29:45,162 --> 01:29:48,295
In case something happens, we
got no more timeouts, okay?

2016
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:49,775
You sure?

2017
01:29:49,949 --> 01:29:51,908
Yeah, I'm sure. We
used our last one.

2018
01:29:52,082 --> 01:29:54,476
I could have swore
we had one more.

2019
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:57,043
This is it. This is for
the money in the bank.

2020
01:29:57,217 --> 01:29:58,741
This is for all the marbles.

2021
01:29:58,915 --> 01:30:00,525
Come on, come on, Dax.

2022
01:30:00,699 --> 01:30:03,136
Buckets, down by two,
a three can win.

2023
01:30:03,310 --> 01:30:05,661
Eight seconds left
in the ball game.

2024
01:30:05,835 --> 01:30:08,315
This is Uncle with it.
Uncle, looking at it.

2025
01:30:09,142 --> 01:30:11,275
Uncle over to Hobbit.

2026
01:30:40,739 --> 01:30:43,829
Yes, we won the Rucker, baby!
We won the Rucker.

2027
01:30:44,003 --> 01:30:45,570
That's what I'm
talkin' about, baby!

2028
01:30:45,744 --> 01:30:47,398
We did this, man! We did that!

2029
01:30:47,572 --> 01:30:48,572
You the man!

2030
01:30:49,356 --> 01:30:51,446
Mookie! Hey, Mookie!

2031
01:30:55,145 --> 01:30:55,972
Good game, man.

2032
01:30:56,146 --> 01:30:57,147
Good game, bro.

2033
01:30:59,062 --> 01:31:02,021
I see what you're doing now.
Playing mind games with me.

2034
01:31:02,195 --> 01:31:06,330
Okay. I'll see you next year, bruh.
The cycle continues.

2035
01:31:08,637 --> 01:31:10,247
Fellas, we did that, y'all.

2036
01:31:10,421 --> 01:31:11,421
Pick him up!

2037
01:31:11,553 --> 01:31:12,902
Pick me up? Hey! No, no, no.

2038
01:31:13,076 --> 01:31:14,164
He's way too heavy, boy.

2039
01:31:14,338 --> 01:31:15,557
His head too big.

2040
01:31:15,731 --> 01:31:17,080
Head weigh about a
hundred pounds.

2041
01:31:19,517 --> 01:31:20,736
I'll be back, y'all.

2042
01:31:23,042 --> 01:31:24,043
Hey.

2043
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:25,480
Hey.

2044
01:31:31,442 --> 01:31:33,444
Oh. This is nice.

2045
01:31:47,153 --> 01:31:49,068
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

2046
01:31:50,330 --> 01:31:51,549
There ya go. That's what

2047
01:31:51,723 --> 01:31:53,203
I'm talking about, young fella.

2048
01:31:56,249 --> 01:31:58,513
The hero, Dax.

2049
01:31:59,905 --> 01:32:03,996
Man, I'm damn proud of you.

2050
01:32:06,216 --> 01:32:07,739
You took that last shot.

2051
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:11,830
You miss a hundred percent
of the shots you don't take.

2052
01:32:13,658 --> 01:32:15,355
Game ball goes to you.

2053
01:32:17,488 --> 01:32:20,665
Your team. Your roster.

2054
01:32:25,627 --> 01:32:28,412
Nah. My family.

2055
01:32:42,774 --> 01:32:46,038
Big Fella, man, I'm really
happy that you're okay, man.

2056
01:32:51,609 --> 01:32:52,610
And if anything...

2057
01:32:55,482 --> 01:32:58,007
We were all really...

2058
01:33:00,618 --> 01:33:03,360
Okay, look, I paid the bill.

2059
01:33:03,969 --> 01:33:05,231
Thanks.

2060
01:33:05,405 --> 01:33:06,972
I had to pay the bill.
You know why?

2061
01:33:07,146 --> 01:33:08,210
That's what you do for family.

2062
01:33:08,234 --> 01:33:10,193
Shh! You still talking?

2063
01:33:10,367 --> 01:33:12,630
Hey, check it out,
we're on SportsCenter.

2064
01:33:12,804 --> 01:33:14,414
Everyone was clowning
him, including us.

2065
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:16,068
Well, you're number one tonight

2066
01:33:16,242 --> 01:33:18,288
in the right top ten
for this right here.

2067
01:33:18,462 --> 01:33:20,943
Dax Winslow, all three of these,

2068
01:33:21,117 --> 01:33:24,599
and the Harlem Buckets
win the Rucker 50.

2069
01:33:24,773 --> 01:33:27,166
I'm still baffled by a
lot of this guy's story.

2070
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:31,475
I don't understand a lot,
frankly, but I know this much.

2071
01:33:31,649 --> 01:33:33,608
He went from a
punchline to a hero,

2072
01:33:33,782 --> 01:33:35,222
getting carried off
on his teammates'

2073
01:33:35,305 --> 01:33:36,915
shoulders in Rucker.

2074
01:33:37,089 --> 01:33:38,613
Way to go, Dax.

2075
01:33:45,141 --> 01:33:46,838
Yo, yo, yo,

2076
01:33:47,012 --> 01:33:48,424
here's the coach of the year.
Dax is here, baby.

2077
01:33:48,448 --> 01:33:49,798
I be the Rucker champ.

2078
01:33:49,972 --> 01:33:51,277
Just leave a message, you know,

2079
01:33:51,451 --> 01:33:52,531
when I give you the chance.

2080
01:33:52,583 --> 01:33:54,367
Hey, Dax, it's, uh, me, Jess.

2081
01:33:54,541 --> 01:33:56,221
When you get a chance,
give me a call back.

2082
01:33:56,369 --> 01:33:58,502
Hey, Dax, it's me again.

2083
01:33:58,676 --> 01:33:59,851
Your phone must be dead,

2084
01:34:00,025 --> 01:34:01,461
'cause it went right
to voicemail.

2085
01:34:01,636 --> 01:34:03,004
Do you remember when I
made that investment

2086
01:34:03,028 --> 01:34:04,428
in them shoes? Do
you remember that?

2087
01:34:04,551 --> 01:34:06,379
You remember that? Do
you remember that?

2088
01:34:06,553 --> 01:34:08,381
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?

2089
01:34:08,555 --> 01:34:10,340
I wanted to let you
know that I went ahead

2090
01:34:10,514 --> 01:34:12,211
and kicked Mook to the curb.

2091
01:34:12,385 --> 01:34:15,737
Uh, I noticed the phone went
straight to voicemail again.

2092
01:34:15,911 --> 01:34:20,219
Do you remember that? Hey.
Dax, do you remember that?

2093
01:34:20,393 --> 01:34:22,613
I am affiliated with
several gangsters.

2094
01:34:22,787 --> 01:34:23,962
I will find out where you at.

2095
01:34:24,136 --> 01:34:25,790
We gonna come over
to your house.

2096
01:34:25,964 --> 01:34:29,402
I let you stay in my house
rent-free for all that time.

2097
01:34:29,576 --> 01:34:31,100
I hate you, Dax.

2098
01:34:31,274 --> 01:34:32,884
But I love you so much.

2099
01:34:33,058 --> 01:34:35,365
I don't know why you're
doing me like this.

2100
01:34:36,758 --> 01:34:38,237
- You know what?
- You, Dax!

2101
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:42,790
Gotta make sure I get
the behind the scene,

2102
01:34:42,894 --> 01:34:44,069
behind the scene.

2103
01:34:45,767 --> 01:34:48,073
Yeah.

2104
01:34:48,247 --> 01:34:49,572
I appreciate you guys
following me to makeup.

2105
01:34:49,596 --> 01:34:51,163
But now, you gots to go.

2106
01:34:59,215 --> 01:35:00,216
Wow!

2107
01:35:10,356 --> 01:35:11,516
Kyrie's under here somewhere.

2108
01:35:15,144 --> 01:35:17,189
Uh-huh. No.

2109
01:35:19,844 --> 01:35:22,412
Hey, girl. Lights
just called me.

2110
01:35:22,586 --> 01:35:25,197
Preacher, you put your Bible
in the club and can't find it?

2111
01:35:28,723 --> 01:35:31,421
Hold up. Wait a minute. Hold on.

2112
01:35:31,595 --> 01:35:33,162
I can't play in that tourney

2113
01:35:33,336 --> 01:35:35,183
and let that little white
boy block my shot again.

2114
01:35:35,207 --> 01:35:36,794
Give me a pudding even though
it's gonna give me diarrhea.

2115
01:35:36,818 --> 01:35:37,969
Hey, I don't mean
to grab your face.

2116
01:35:37,993 --> 01:35:39,429
I'm sorry.

2117
01:35:39,603 --> 01:35:41,736
Hold up, hold up. Run
it back, run it back.

2118
01:35:41,910 --> 01:35:43,520
Don't you wanna go with a coach

2119
01:35:43,694 --> 01:35:45,130
who straight up looks like Urkel

2120
01:35:45,304 --> 01:35:47,437
got put in a trash compactor?

2121
01:35:47,611 --> 01:35:50,048
Isn't that what you want?

2122
01:35:50,222 --> 01:35:52,790
Wait a minute. Run that back.
Just run it back.

2123
01:35:52,964 --> 01:35:54,139
Don't you wanna be coached

2124
01:35:54,313 --> 01:35:55,593
by a dude who looks like an M&M?

2125
01:35:57,186 --> 01:35:58,448
Double or nothin' this time.

2126
01:35:58,622 --> 01:36:00,624
Double or nothin',
double or nothin'.

2127
01:36:00,798 --> 01:36:02,017
Hey, man, you don't

2128
01:36:02,191 --> 01:36:03,409
blow no whistle in my gym.

2129
01:36:08,980 --> 01:36:10,721
Okay, that's... Okay... Stop!

2130
01:36:10,895 --> 01:36:13,158
Or little hobbit here
could take his spot.

2131
01:36:13,332 --> 01:36:14,943
Who you callin' a
hobbit, Uncle Ben?

2132
01:36:15,117 --> 01:36:16,596
Uncle Ben?

2133
01:36:16,771 --> 01:36:18,331
You heard what I said.
Get me some rice.

2134
01:36:18,424 --> 01:36:20,818
No, no, no...

2135
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:23,865
Youngblood, I can't take this
rappity-hippity-hop nonsense.

2136
01:36:24,039 --> 01:36:25,301
You say "hippity-hoppity."

2137
01:36:25,475 --> 01:36:26,258
That's something
rabbits would make.

2138
01:36:26,432 --> 01:36:27,651
If rabbits made music,

2139
01:36:27,825 --> 01:36:29,479
it would be called
hippity-hoppity.

2140
01:36:29,653 --> 01:36:31,655
You know how old this van is?
Older than you.

2141
01:36:31,829 --> 01:36:33,048
I assume it is, brother.

2142
01:36:33,222 --> 01:36:35,485
Lots gone down in here.

2143
01:36:35,659 --> 01:36:37,400
Somethin' went down here,
stained that seat.

2144
01:36:38,227 --> 01:36:40,664
Feel good about that.

2145
01:36:40,838 --> 01:36:44,624
Got a microwave in here,
you got carpet everywhere.

2146
01:36:44,799 --> 01:36:46,039
Ain't no tellin' what old women

2147
01:36:46,191 --> 01:36:47,453
you'd have back there.

2148
01:36:47,627 --> 01:36:48,866
Probably had your
momma back there.

2149
01:36:48,890 --> 01:36:50,108
- You ever say...
- Ooh!

2150
01:36:50,282 --> 01:36:51,762
I'm an orphan, for
your information.

2151
01:36:51,936 --> 01:36:53,459
So I don't know who my momma is.

2152
01:36:55,244 --> 01:36:58,073
This is what we call a ditty now.
Ooh.

2153
01:36:58,247 --> 01:37:02,947
My lady... That ditty just crazy.
Mmm!

2154
01:37:03,121 --> 01:37:04,644
I got it. This is
the real version.

2155
01:37:04,819 --> 01:37:06,951
We not goin' be disrespecting
a classic like that.

2156
01:37:07,125 --> 01:37:08,365
That came out before you was...

2157
01:37:08,474 --> 01:37:10,085
- You have to drive.
- Oh, I forgot.

2158
01:37:14,002 --> 01:37:17,483
Get out of here. Go!

2159
01:37:17,657 --> 01:37:20,269
Courses. I've come a
long way since Kazaam.

2160
01:37:21,357 --> 01:37:22,706
That is sick!

2161
01:37:34,544 --> 01:37:35,744
I found him in a grocery store

2162
01:37:35,893 --> 01:37:37,173
putting cans on the top shelves.

2163
01:37:37,286 --> 01:37:38,940
That's all he's good for.

2164
01:37:40,332 --> 01:37:41,464
I'm sorry.

2165
01:37:45,511 --> 01:37:47,557
You are my Beyonce, okay?

2166
01:37:47,731 --> 01:37:51,039
Not Dantay, not White
Dantay, not Jeff,

2167
01:37:51,213 --> 01:37:54,129
and not the dude who look like
he sang with New Addition.

2168
01:37:54,303 --> 01:37:55,434
I'm so sorry.

2169
01:37:55,608 --> 01:37:56,783
I'm so sorry.

2170
01:38:10,188 --> 01:38:12,364
Rapid fire. I gotta
go rapid fire.

2171
01:38:36,084 --> 01:38:37,912
Here we go. Watch
this right here.

2172
01:38:38,086 --> 01:38:39,217
Ow! Ow!

2173
01:38:42,612 --> 01:38:43,787
What is this, man?

2174
01:38:43,961 --> 01:38:46,224
That look like a dead inch worm.

2175
01:38:48,531 --> 01:38:49,971
Who you trying to be?
Morgan Freeman?

2176
01:38:53,275 --> 01:38:55,755
You played a heck of
a game today, sir.

2177
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:57,279
Appreciate you
saying that, Coach.

2178
01:38:57,453 --> 01:38:59,498
You ever think about
re-taking those SATs?

2179
01:38:59,672 --> 01:39:02,327
You have four years left
of eligibility, right?

2180
01:39:02,501 --> 01:39:04,181
I'm more of a Blue Devil
man myself, Coach.

2181
01:39:06,766 --> 01:39:07,942
Come on, Dax!

2182
01:39:10,118 --> 01:39:12,381
Oh, too late, Drew. Too late.

2183
01:39:12,555 --> 01:39:14,339
Your old-ass legs broke
up on you, Drew.
